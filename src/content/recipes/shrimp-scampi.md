!Shrimp Scampi

Yields: 4 servings

NOTE: This does not keep well, so eat leftovers within 1-2 days.

## Ingredients
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/4 medium bunch fresh parsley^^1^^
* 1 pound raw jumbo shrimp (21 to 30 per pound), thawed if frozen^^2^^
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter^^3^^
* 1/2 cup dry white wine or low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1/2 medium lemon, or 1-1/2 to 2 T lemon juice
* Cooked pasta, rice, or crusty bread, for serving (optional)

## Directions
# Mince 2 garlic cloves. Pick the leaves from 1/4 medium bunch fresh parsley and finely chop until you have 2 tablespoons. If needed, peel and devein 1 pound raw jumbo shrimp (keep the tails on if desired). Pat dry with paper towels.
# Season the shrimp all over with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.
# Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the shrimp in a single layer and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a plate.
# Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons unsalted butter to the now-empty skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until the butter melts. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and starting to turn golden-brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
# Add 1/2 cup dry white wine or low-sodium chicken broth, and 1 pinch red pepper flakes if desired. Cook, scraping up any browned bits from the pan, until the liquid is reduced by about half, about 6 minutes.
# Return the shrimp and any accumulated juices to the skillet. Add the parsley and squeeze the juice from 1/2 medium lemon over the shrimp, and toss to combine. Serve garnished with more black pepper and with cooked pasta or crusty bread if desired.


^^1^^ Can substitute with 1 T dried parsley.  

^^2^^ Can use precooked shrimp and skip parts of step 1 and all of step 3.  

^^3^^ I have used salted butter, and it has not been too salty.
