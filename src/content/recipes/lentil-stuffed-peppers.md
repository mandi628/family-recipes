# Lentil Stuffed Peppers

Serves: 4

## Ingredients
* 6 bell peppers halved and seeds removed
* 1 cup cooked rice can use quinoa, barley, or farro
* 1 cup cooked lentils can use canned
* 1 cup low-moisture mozzarella cheese shredded (¼ cup mixed in and ¼ cup on top)
* ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 can 14.5 oz diced tomatoes
* 6 garlic cloves minced
* 1 onion diced
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried
* 2 teaspoons fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
* 2 tablespoons fresh basil chopped
* ¼ cup fresh parsley chopped

## Directions
# Preheat the oven to 400°F.
# In a large pot, cook the rice according to the package instructions. In a separate pot, cook the lentils according to package instructions.
# In a large skillet, sauté the onion over medium heat until it becomes translucent, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.
# Add the cooked rice, cooked lentils, diced tomatoes (with their juices), ¼ cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and parsley to a bowl. Mix in the sauteed vegetables until well combined.
# Slice the peppers in half and scoop out the seeds and white membranes. I like to keep the steam intact, if give you a larger well to scoop the filling and it just looks nice.
# Place the bell pepper halves in a baking dish. Fill each half with the lentil mixture, using a spoon to pack it in tightly. Top each pepper half with the remaining ¼ cup of shredded mozzarella cheese.
# Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
