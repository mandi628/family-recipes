# Sourdough Bread

Cook Time: 17-23 hours
Serves: 1 loaf

NOTE: The original recipe is from [Sourdough Home](https://sourdoughhome.com.html). I have made notes on my adjustments here.

* 1 cup active [sourdough starter](Sourdough Starter.html)
* 3 cups all-purpose or bread flour^^1^^
* 1 cup warm water
* 1-1/2 tsp salt

# Combine ingredients in a mixing bowl. Cover and set aside for 12-18 hours.
# Uncover and lightly stir dough. Grease your pan and place the dough in the pan. Cover with oiled foil and let sit for up to 4 hours - until double in size.
# Place covered pan in cold oven, and set the oven to 425F^^2^^ and leave for 50 minutes^^3^^.
# Remove the cover, and bake 15 minutes more^^4^^.
# Leave bread in pan to cool for 15 minutes, before turning out onto a cooling rack.
# Let cool at least 15 minutes more before slicing.

2023.12.20 - As I mentioned in the footnotes, the original temperature is pretty high, and the baking time long. My first two loaves resulted in a very dark crust, and I prefer a lighter crust. I will try a slightly lower temperature and shorter times, as indicated above.  


^^1^^ I have only used bread flour so far. I have not tried all-purpose flour yet. 2023.12.20 ama  

^^2^^ Original recipe says 450F, but I find it makes the crust to dark in the given time.  

^^3^^ Original recipe says 53 minutes.  

^^4^^ Original recipe says 18 minutes.
