# Pasta alla Norma

Yields: 5 svgs

## Ingredients
* 2 eggplants (about 2 pounds in total)
* Kosher salt
* Extra virgin olive oil
* 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 2 (14.5-ounce) cans diced tomatoes with their juices
* 1 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 3/4 pound rigatoni pasta
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1/2 cup grated ricotta salata, or Parmesan

## Directions
# Prep the eggplant. Trim the eggplant, then and partially peel them from top to bottom in a striped pattern. Slice them into 1/2-inch thick rounds, then season all over with salt. Set aside for a few minutes to expel their bitterness (ideally 30 minutes if you have time).
# Meanwhile, get ready to roast. Heat the oven to 425°F. Brush the bottom of a large sheet pan with olive oil.
# Roast the eggplant. Use a paper towel to wipe the eggplant dry and remove excess salt, then arrange the eggplant slices in the pans in one single layer. (Eggplant slices should not overlap, each should be comfortably touching the bottom of the sheet pan. Use two oiled sheet pans if necessary.) Roast in the heated oven for 20 minutes, then flip and rotate until deeply golden brown, anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes more.
# Meanwhile, make the sauce. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a separate large deep pan, heat 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, lower the heat and cook, tossing regularly, until the garlic gains a little bit of color. Add the tomatoes (with their juices), oregano, and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a quick boil, then lower the heat and let simmer briefly.
# Finish the sauce and cook the pasta. When the eggplant is golden and tender, remove from the oven and stir into the sauce. Let simmer while you cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to package instructions (mine took about 11 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water before draining.
# Finish and serve. Add the pasta to the sauce and give it a good stir. If the sauce looks a bit dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water and toss until the pasta is well-coated. Taste and adjust seasoning. Finish with the chopped parsley and grated ricotta salata.
