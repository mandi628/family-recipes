# Mediterranean Lentil Salad

Yields: 6 svgs

## Ingredients
* 1 cup dry green lentils or black lentils
* Seeds of 1 pomegranate
* Water
* Kosher salt
* 1 small red onion chopped
* 3/4 English cucumber small diced or chopped (about 2 1/2 cups)
* 2 to 3 cups baby spinach or other leafy green of choice
* 1 cup chopped fresh parsley
* Crumbled feta cheese for garnish

### Lime Dressing
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tsp honey
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp ground allspice
* Salt and pepper

## Directions
# Cook the lentils. In a saucepan, combine lentils with 3 cups of water and pinch of kosher salt. Bring to a boil. Cover, and lower heat to medium-low. Let simmer until the lentils are fully tender (anywhere from 25 to 45 minutes depending on the kind of lentils used). Be sure to check and add water if lentils seem too dry during the cooking process (they should absorb a lot of the water. Drain and set aside to cool.
# In a large mixing bowl, combine cooked lentils with chopped onions, cucumbers, baby spinach, parsley, and pomegranate seeds (arils.) Give everything a gentle toss.
# Make the dressing. In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the lime dressing ingredients. Pour the dressing over the lentil salad and toss to combine. Add a sprinkle of feta cheese to finish.
# Allow a few minutes for the flavors to meld before serving.
