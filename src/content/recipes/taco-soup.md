# Taco Soup

Yields: 12 svgs

## Ingredients
* 1 lb. ground meat (beef, port, turkey, etc. - you can also use shredded chicken from a rotisserie chicken)
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 green pepper, diced
* 2 cans diced tomatoes
* 1 can diced tomatoes w/chiles
* 2 14 oz. cans pinto beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 14 oz. can other beans (black beans, kidney beans, cannelini or white beans), drained and rinsed
* 2 cans whole-kernel corn, un-drained
* 1 pkg. taco seasoning
* 1 pkg. Ranch seasoning
* shredded cheese
* sour cream
* tortilla chips (we like scoop chips)

## Directions
# Place the ground beef, onion, and green peppers in the Crockpot and cook on high for one hour.
#* You can also cook these in a pan and add to the Crockpot.
#* If making vegetarian, skip the meat.
# Stir and chop the meat, then add all the canned ingredients and seasoning ingredients.
# Cook on high for 2-3 hours, or low for 4-6 hours.
# Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips.
#* If serving vegetarian, you can add TVP or tofu individually at this point.
#* If serving to a mixed audience, you can cook the meat separately and season to taste, and prepare TVP, seasoning to taste.

### Stovetop
If cooking on the stovetop, follow the directions above, just in a soup pot instead. Simmer on low for up to an hour before serving.
