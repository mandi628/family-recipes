# Mushroom Parmesan

* 6 large portobello mushrooms (about 4 ounces each)
* 4 tbsp olive oil, divided
* 3/4 tsp kosher salt, plus more as needed
* 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 6 oz low-moisture mozzarella cheese
* 1 oz Parmesan cheese (1/2 cup firmly packed freshly grated or 1/3 cup store-bought grated)
* 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 2 cups marinara sauce, divided
* 2 sprigs fresh basil

# Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F.
# Remove and discard the stems from 6 large portobello mushrooms and discard. Brush the mushrooms all over with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Place stem-side down in a 9x13-inch baking dish (it’s OK if they’re slightly overlapping).
# Roast until just beginning to soften, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, grate 6 ounces mozzarella cheese on the large holes of a box grater (about 1 1/2 cups). Finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup firmly packed) on the smallest holes of the box grater, or measure out 1/3 cup store-bought grated.
# Place 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs, the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and 1 pinch kosher salt in a small bowl. Stir to combine.
# Remove the baking dish from the oven. Transfer the mushrooms to a cutting board or large plate. Spread 3/4 cup of the marinara sauce over the bottom of the baking dish, stirring to combine it with any liquid released from the mushrooms. Return the mushrooms to the baking dish in an even layer stem-side up. Evenly divide the remaining 1 1/4 cups marinara sauce between the mushrooms (scant 1/4 cup per mushroom) and spread in an even layer. Top evenly with the Parmesan, mozzarella, and panko mixture.
# Roast until the mushrooms are tender, the cheese is melted, and the panko just starts to brown, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pick the leaves from 1/2 small bunch fresh basil and finely chop until you have 2 tablespoons.
# Turn on the broiler and broil until the cheese and panko on top is browned in spots, 2 to 3 minutes more. Serve garnished with the chopped basil.
