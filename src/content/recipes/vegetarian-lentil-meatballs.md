# Vegetarian Lentil Meatballs

* 1/2 cup brown lentils
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/4 cup chopped red or white onion
* 1 large clove garlic, minced
* 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp rolled oats
* 1 large egg
* 3 tsp Italian seasoning
* 1 tbsp grated Parmesan (optional)
* salt & pepper

# Place the lentils, 1.5 cups of water, and bay leaf in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium low and let cook until water evaporates and lentils are tender, about 20 minutes.
# While the lentils cook, heat the 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet. Once oil is shimmering, add the onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
# Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
# Once lentils, onions, and garlic are all cooked, transfer to a food processor with the rolled oats, egg, Italian seasoning,Parmesan (if using), and season with salt and pepper. Pulse until able to be formed into balls. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
# Remove the lentil mixture from the fridge and roll into balls, placing the finished balls on the baking sheet.
# Cook the balls for 10 minutes, turn, and cook another 8 to 10 minutes or until balls are browned and firm.
# Serve the lentil balls over spaghetti or enjoy as preferred.
