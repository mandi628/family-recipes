# Bean-fu

This is a recipe/method for making "tofu" style products at home, with beans that are not soy. This recipe is from a video on Instagram.

* 1 cup desired beans (black beans, lentils, split peas, etc.)
* 2 cups water

# Place the beans in a container, cover with warm water, and soak overnight.
# Drain the beans and add them with some water to a blender or food processor (1:2 ratio). Blend until beans are chopped up.
# Place the mixture in a pan on the stove over medium-low to medium heat and cook until it thickens to a paste.
# Place the mixture in a container and refrigerate for 24 hours.
# Cut into bite-size pieces and use as you would tofu.
