# Homemade Yogurt

* 1/2 gallon milk (whole, 2%, or skim)
* 1/2 cup fresh yogurt ^^1^^

# Place the milk in a crockpot and cook on high for 2-3 hours, or until the milk reaches a temperature of 180 degrees.
# Turn of the crockpot and let the milk sit another 2-3 hours, or until it reaches a temperature of 110-120 degrees.
# Stir in the yogurt, cover the pot, and wrap it in dark towels or a blanket. Place the crock in a cool dark place for 8-12 hours, or until the culture has cured.
# If desired, you can strain the yogurt before placing in jars to store in the fridge. Or, just jar and store. Eat as you would any plain yogurt - you can eat it as is, or use it for baking, dressings, etc.

^^1^^ The first time, you will have to use store bought yogurt, or a yogurt starter from someone else. After that, use the last 1/2 cup of yogurt from your last batch.
