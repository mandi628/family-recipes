# Shrimp with Garlic

Makes 2 servings.

* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 lb. shrimp, rinsed

# Combine the oil, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce in a medium-sized bowl. Add the shrimp. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
# Pour the marinade into a frying pan. Heat over medium heat.
# When hot, add the shrimp. Fry until lightly golden.
