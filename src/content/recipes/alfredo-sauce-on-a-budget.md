!Alfredo Sauce on a Budget

Fresh Parmesan cheese can be expensive, but you can still have a nice white sauce for Alfredo dishes - over pasta, [Italian Mac & Cheese](Italian Mac & Cheese.html), on pizza, etc.

This recipe is similar to [Basic Cheese Sauce](Basic Cheese Sauce.html), just with a different flavor profile.

Yields: 4 servings

!!Ingredients
* 1/4 C butter (half a stick)
* 3 T all-purpose flour
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2-1/2 C milk (any amount of the milk can be substituted with heavy cream or half-and-half for a richer sauce)
* 2 C shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

!!Directions
# Melt butter in a saucepan set over medium-low heat, then sprinkle in the flour. Whisk the mixture for two minutes, to prevent scorching.
# Add minced garlic, and continue whisking until fragrant.
# Increase the stovetop to medium heat and slowly add milk, while continuing to whisk, while continuing to whisk, to prevent lumps from forming. Continue until all of the milk has been added.
# Melt cheese into the sauce a handful at a time. Repeat until all of the cheese has been added and has melted into a smooth sauce. Then, stir in the Italian seasoning and black pepper.
# Check the consistency of the sauce. If it is too thin, let it simmer for a couple of minutes, until it thickens. If it is too thick, make sure the cheese has fully melted, then stir in a couple of splashes of milk, as needed.
# Serve immediately over fettuccine pasta noodles.
