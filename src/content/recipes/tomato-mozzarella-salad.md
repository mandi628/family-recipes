# Tomato-Mozzarella Salad

There are lots of ways to make this classic Italian appetizer, and it can be found in lots of other cuisines, as well.

## Ingredients
* Tomatoes
* Fresh whole-milk mozzarella, or [homemade mozzarella](Mozzarella Cheese.html)
* Spinach or whole basil leaves
* Dressing

## Directions
My favorite way to make this is to slice large heritage or beefsteak tomatoes and layer the slices with slices of fresh mozzarella, on top of a bed of spinach. Then top with your favorite Italian dressing or Balsamic Vinaigrette.

Another way is to use the small mozzarella pearls and either dice up some fresh tomatoes, or use grape tomatoes. Toss these with your greens of choice and drizzle with your dressing of choice.
