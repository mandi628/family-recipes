# Green Beans with Buttered Bread Crumbs


<<<
This was Nana's favorite way to serve green beans.

<<<

Alla Catherine Zalisko (Nana), was born in January of 1936 near Rivno, Ukraine. Her grandfather was a Ukrainian Orthodox Priest, so the family fled to Poland when the Russian government outlawed the Ukrainian church. Nana was about 3-4 years old, at the time.

During their time in Poland, her older brother by about 10 years, Syeva, lost his eyesight and several fingers while playing with a detonator he had found in the street. The Germans eventually came and an officer took up residence in their house. When things started to get bad, the officer gave Nana's father a heads up, and they fled Poland that night. Eventually, they ended up in Regensburg Displaced Persons camp in Germany where they met the Marchenkos. Syeva became best friends with Mykola and the rest is history.

After the families made their way to the United States, Mykola, who was waiting for Alla to grow up and finish high school, eventually went to New York to marry her and brought her back to Chicago, where he was living and working. They had Catherine Elizabeth in June of 1956, George Nicholas in August 1957, William Andrew in May 1961, and Natalie Anne in February 1967.

Catherine married David Ray Saidat in January of 1976. They had Amanda Chiristine in June 1976, Eric Arthur in January 1978, Heidi Anna in April 1979, and Alexander Mykola in April 1981. Amanda married Mark David Aumann in May 1999. They had Abigail, Mykola, Suzanne, and Theresa.

# Ingredients
* Butter
* Breadcrumbs
* Green beans, fresh or frozen

## Directions
# Cook the green beans to desired doneness.
# Melt the butter in a saute pan - about 1 T for each 1/2 C of bread crumbs.
# Keeping the heat at medium, so the butter doesn't burn, sprinkle the breadcrumbs into the butter and let them toast and saute. You'll know they're done when they start sizzling.
# When the beans are done, drain them well.
# Top the green beans with the breadcrumbs and stir together. If the beans are too wet, the breadcrumbs will get soggy. You can leave them separate and top at the table, if preferred.
