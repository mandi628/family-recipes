# Sourdough Pizza Crust

<<<
Remember that my [Sourdough Starter](Sourdough Starter.html) recipe keeps 1 cup of starter on hand, so the discard will be about 1/2 cup each time. You will need to feed the discard and let it sit 12 hours (or overnight) before using it for a 12" crust.
<<<

### 12" Crust (Medium pizza)
* 1 cup [Sourdough Starter](Sourdough Starter.html) (surplus or discard)
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 - 1-1/2 cups flour

### 14" Crust (Large pizza)
* 1-1/2 cups [Sourdough Starter](Sourdough Starter.html) (surplus or discard)
* 1-1/2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1-1/4 tsp salt
* 1-1/2 - 2 cups flour

# Preheat oven to 450F
# Mix ingredients, working in the flour until you have a soft dough (start with one cup of flour and gradually add more as needed). If it's too dry, add a little more starter or water. If it's too wet, add more flour.
# Knead the dough for 5 minutes, let it rest 5 minutes, then knead for 5 minutes more.
# Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes.
# Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper and roll it out into a 12" or 14" circle.
# **If using immediately:** Top and bake until preferred doneness.
# **If pre-baking:** Dock the dough with a fork (poke holes in it). Place in the oven (parchment and all) on a pan, pizza peel, or baker's stone, and bake for 5 minutes.
# **If using out of the oven:** Brush with olive oil to prevent sogginess, then top and bake.
# **If freezing:** Cool and store in 1-gallon freezer bag in the freezer. When ready to use, thaw it and brush with olive oil, then top and bake at 450F as desired.
