# Big Mac (Homemade)

If you use "real" cheese, this won't be vegan, of course, and it also will depend on your ingredients in the [Vegan Burger Patty](Vegan Burger Patty.html) recipe.

Makes 1 sandwich.

* 2 plant-based meat patties, 3 oz. each ([Vegan Burger Patty](Vegan Burger Patty.html))
** Of course, you can use your favorite meat patties here instead.
* 2 slices American (or other) cheese
* 1/2 C shredded iceberg lettuce
* 5-6 dill pickle slices
* 2 T diced onion
* 1 sesame bun + bottom half of another bun (4-1/2" wide is recommended)

**Big Mac Sauce**

* 1 C Mayo
* 1/4 C ketchup
* 2 T yellow mustard
* 2 T sweet relish
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 T white vinegar

# Combine ingredients for the Big Mac Sauce. Stir until well combined. Season to taste and then set aside in the fridge for 30 minutes.
# To prepare your middle bun, use a serrated knife and shave off just the bottom of the extra bottom bun.
# Press or form your burger patties so they match the circumference of your buns.
# Grill buns in a bit of oil or butter (or do a dry toast) until lightly golden brown. Set aside (ideally on a wire rack so they don't get soggy).
# To the same pan or griddle, over medium-medium high heat, add a little oil and then add the burger patties to the pan. Season with salt and pepper and grill for about 3 minutes. Once patties are browned, give 'em a flip!
# After you flip the patties, add a slice of cheese to each one and cover with a melting dome. You can add a little water before covering to steam the cheese too!
# Once cheese is melted, assemble as follow: bottom bun, sauce, lettuce, burger patty, onions, middle bun, sauce, pickles, lettuce, burger patty, sauce, top bun. ENJOY!
