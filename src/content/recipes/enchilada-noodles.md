!Enchilada Noodles

Serves 1.

* 3-1/2 oz. spaghetti
* 4 T enchilada sauce
* 2T canned corn, drained
* 2 T canned black beans, rinsed & drained
* 2 T fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1 scallion or green onion, chopped
* 1/3 C Cheddar cheese, grated/shredded
* Your choice of additional toppings (sour cream, guacamole, avocado, salsa, tomato, etc.)

# Cook the spaghetti to al dente and drain.
# Place the spaghetti in a saucepan and add the enchilada sauce, corn, beans, cilantro, onions, and cheese. Mix to combine and heat over medium heat until cheese is melted and everything is hot.
# Serve and top with your favorite toppings.

NOTE: So far, when making this recipe, I have increased the pasta only by double, but used the whole can of sauce, corn, and black beans. It easily could serve 4 that way.
