# Creamy Cowboy Caviar

Serves 6

* 1 can black beans, drained
* 1 can black-eyes peas, drained
* 1 red pepper, diced
* 3 small green onions, diced (or 1 large)
* 1 can sweet corn, drained
* 2 T pumpkin seeds
* 2 T sliced black olives

**Dressing**

* 1 T sliced pickled jalapenos (optional)
* 1 T apple cider vinegar
* 1 T fresh lime juice
* Fresh cilantro
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 T olive oil
* 1 ripe avocado, skin removed
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 2 T water

# Add all of the salad ingredients to a large mixing bowl (the first group of items).
# In a food processor, add the pickled jalapenos, apple cider vinegar, lime juice, cilantro, cumin, and olive oil. Blitz until fairy well chopped. Add the avocado and a generous pinch of salt and pepper, and blitz again until fairly smooth. If the mixture seems a little thick, add a splash of water - it should be thin enough to lightly coat the salad.
# Add the dressing to the bowl, and mix thoroughly. Serve chilled with cheese quesadillas and greens.
# Ideas for add-ins: diced tomatoes, diced cucumber, other types of beans, crumbled feta, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, chopped peanuts, grated cheddar, diced red onion.
