# Baked Egg Muffins

Time: 40 minutes
Servings: 4 (2 muffins per person)

## Ingredients:
* 1-1/2 C cherry tomatoes, halved
* 2 oz. feta cheese, cubed or crumbled
* 6 large eggs
* 1/4 t salt
* ground pepper to taste
* fresh basil, thinly sliced (for garnish)

## Directions:
# Preheat oven to 325°F. Coat 8 muffin-tin cups with cooking spray or use silicone muffin-tin liners.
# Divide tomatoes and feta among the prepared cups. Whisk eggs, salt and pepper to taste in a medium bowl. Pour the eggs over the tomatoes and feta in the muffin cups. Top with basil, if desired.
# Bake until the eggs are set, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes before serving. If not serving immediately, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before refrigerating for up to 4 days or freezing for up to 3 months.

## Variations:
* Replace tomatoes with 1-1/2 C of other chopped vegetables - onions, bell peppers, celery, etc.
* Replace feta with other shredded cheese (I.e. Cheddar).
