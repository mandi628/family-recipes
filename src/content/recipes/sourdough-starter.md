# Sourdough Starter

<<<
These instructions will keep one cup of active starter on hand at all times. Most bread recipes call for 1 cup of starter, so you can double the starter instructions to have more on hand, or you can follow the suggested schedule listed below.
<<<

There are starters you can buy. Some are cheap, some are expensive. But it's easy to start your own.  


# In a clean jar that will hold at least 24 oz., stir together 1/2 cup flour^^1^^ and 1/2 cup warm water.^^2^^ Stir it well. Cover the jar with a clean cloth and a rubberband, and wait 24 hours.
# Place 1/2 cup of your starter in a new jar, and add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup warm water. Stir it together well. Cover again and wait 24 hours. You can throw out the remaining starter from the first jar.
# Repeat Step 2.
# On the fourth day, you will repeat step 2, but only wait 12 hours before the next feeding. By now, you should notice bubbling in the starter. Continue feeding it every 12 hours.
# After about 10 days, the starter should be strong enough to raise bread. You also want it to be relatively thick - it should be the consistency of thick glue. If it's not thick enough, add a little extra flour at the next feeding. If it's too thick, add a little extra water.^^4^^
# When the starter gets to this point, you should be able to feed it every 24 hours again to maintain it.
# Once you have enough activity, you can start using the discard for something like [Sourdough Pancakes](Sourdough Pancakes.html), [Sourdough Crepes](Sourdough Crepes.html), or [Sourdough Pizza Crust](Sourdough Pizza Crust.html). You can also measure off two portions of starter and setup two new jars. Keep one out to rise, and put the second one in the fridge. Be sure to feed the backup jar at least once a week.^^3^^
# You now have a starter ready to make [Sourdough Bread](Sourdough Bread.html), [Sourdough English Muffins](Sourdough English Muffins.html), or anything else you can think of. Mama also has a worksheet on her computer that allows you to convert any bread recipe into a sourdough recipe.

## Suggested Schedule
* Feed the starter at least once a day, preferably in the morning.
* In the morning, separate the starter into 1/2 cup for feeding, and 1/2 cup for proofing. Put the feeder in a jar and cover, as usual, and the proofer in a mixing bowl.
* 12 hours later (in the evening), use the proofer as recommended in the [Sourdough Bread](Sourdough Bread.html) recipe. Add the flour, water, and salt and proof over night.
* The next morning, feed your starter as normal, and place the proofer in the pan for the last rise. If you want, you can use the jarred starter to start proofing another loaf.
* After 4 hours, bake your proofed bread as stated in the recipe.

^^1^^ Some people swear by whole grain wheat flour or rye flour. I just used plain all-purpose white flour and had good results.  

^^2^^ Some sources swear that tap water with chlorine will not work to start a starter. I have started with tap water with no problems, and I used spring water from the store. I honestly can't say if one was better than the other. The starter worked both ways.  

^^3^^ To feed the backup jar, take it out the night before and let it come to room temperature. Do a regular feeding in the morning and leave it to rise. At night, do one more regular feeding, but put it back in the fridge.  

^^4^^ I have found that sometimes the starter gets a little thin. That's ok - as long as it gets bubbly, it's still active. But if you want it to rise, it needs to be thicker. If it's getting thin, then short the water when feeding it. You can use as little as 1/4 cup.
