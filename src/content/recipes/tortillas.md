!Tortillas

!!Ingredients
* 2/3 C very warm water
* 1-1/2 tsp salt
* 2 cups flour
* 5 T melted butter, or neutral oil (vegetable, olive, etc.)
* 1 tsp baking powder (optional)

!!Steps
# Dissolve the salt in the warm water in a small container.
# In a separate bowl, pour the melted butter into the flour and stir with a fork until the oil is distributed evenly and it resembles course crumbs.
# Stir in most of the warm water.
# Stir until a dough forms, then knead for 2-3 minutes. If the dough is too dry, add more of the water. Dough should be fairly soft.
# Place dough in a covered container and let sit for 15 min - 2 hours.
# Divide dough into smaller portions:
## 6" tortillas (taco size) = 12 balls of 40g each
## 8" tortillas (fajita size) = 8 balls of 60g each
## 10" tortillas (burrito size) = 6 balls of 80g each
# Roll out to desired size, and as thin as possible.
# Cook in a dry pan on medium to medium-high heat for 20-30 seconds per side.
