# Naan Bread

* 2/3 warm water
* 2-1/4 tsp dry yeast (one packet)
* 2 tsp sugar
* 2 cups flour
* 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 4 Tbsp melted butter (for brushing on top)
* oil for cooking

# Soften yeast in a small bowl by stirring together warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit 5-10 minutes.
# In a large bowl, combine flour, yogurt, olive oil and salt. Stir in yeast mixture and mix well. Knead with your hands until the dough comes together, then knead for 5-10 minutes, until dough is smooth.
# Set aside in a covered bowl to rise for 1 hour, or until double in size.
# Place dough on a floured board and divide into 8 equal portions. Roll each one out to about an 8" diameter and 1/8" thick.
# Preheat a skillet on medium heat and brush with oil. Place a dough circle in the pan and cook for 3 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the second side.
# When done, brush both sides with butter. Serve immediately, or wrap for storage. If refrigerated, microwave 15 seconds to warm before eating.
