# Overnight Oats

<<<
This is great for meal-prep, when you want to have a grab-and-go breakfast. There are a lot of these recipes on the Internet, and they are all pretty much the same, so I have not given credit here.
<<<

* rolled oats
* milk (any kind will work)
* yogurt (Greek or regular, but plain)
* sweetener (sugar, maple syrup, honey, etc.)
* chia seeds (optional)
* vanilla extract (or other, if desired)
* salt
* toppings:
** fruit
** chocolate chips
** peanut butter (1 Tbsp per serving)
** nuts

You will place the ingredients into single-serving jars (I use 1 pint canning jars), and store in the fridge until eating time. They will keep for up to 5 days.

# Place 1/2 cup oats into each jar.
# Place 1/2 cup milk into each jar.
# Top with 1/4 cup yogurt in each jar.
# Add 1-2 tsp of your chosen sweetener to each jar.
# If using chia seeds, add 1 tsp of them to each jar.
# Add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt to each jar.
# Cover and store in the fridge for a minimum of 8 hours before eating.
# Just before serving, top with your favorite toppings and eat. You can also warm in the microwave, if you prefer it warmed.
