# Gravy

Many sauces use a similar formula. What makes them different is what you put in it. The basic formula for any sauce is:

* 1 T fat
* 1 T starch (flour or cornstarch, usually)
* 1 C liquid

You melt the fat, stir in the starch and cook it a little, then gradually whisk in the liquid. You can make it thicker by increasing the fat and starch. You make it thinner by increasing the liquid. Here are the details for a good gravy.

## Ingredients
* 1 T fat - you can use fat from cooking the meat, oil, or butter
* 1 T starch
** flour makes it opaque in color
** cornstarch makes it clear looking
* 1 C broth - this can be dripping from the cooking pan, broth from a box, soup broth, or bouillon broth
* seasoning - this will vary depending on the purpose and flavor profile of your dish
** If using broth from a box or bouillon, you may want to skip any salt

## Directions if using flour
# Heat the fat in a sauce pan.
# Sprinkle in the flour and stir until smooth.
# Gradually add the broth, stirring constantly over medium-low to medium heat.
# Once all the broth is added, stir in any seasoning or herbs you chose. Continue stirring constantly until the gravy starts to thicken and boil.
# As soon as it starts boiling, start a countdown for one minute. Continue stirring until time is up. Your gravy is done.

## Directions if using cornstarch
# Heat the fat in a sauce pan.
# Slowly add in the liquid and cook until heated through, stirring frequently.
# Combine the cornstarch with 1 T water and stir well.
# Once the broth comes to a boil, pour in the cornstarch slurry while stirring constantly.
# Keep stirring until the gravy thickens - it should take about 1-2 minutes.
