# Vegetable Lasagna Soup

**Serves 3**

* 1 Tbsp oil
* 1 small onion (or 1/2 large)
* 2 medium carrots (~ 160g / ~ 5 1/2 oz)
* 1 large celery stick (~ 80g / ~ 3 oz)
* 125 g (~ 4 1/2 oz) mushrooms
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 400 g tin (~ 1 1/3 cups) chopped tomatoes
* 1 vegetable stock cube, crumbled
* 750 ml (~ 3 cups) water
* 200 g (~ 7 oz) dried lasagna sheets
* 2 Tbsp basil pesto
* 125 ml (~ 1/2 cup) single cream
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 125 g (~ 4 1/2 oz) fresh mozzarella

# Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Dice the onion, carrots, celery, and mushrooms quite finely, and add them to the pan. Cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring regularly, until slightly softened, but not browned.

# Add the minced garlic and thyme, and cook for 2 more minutes. Then add the tin of tomatoes, as well as the crumbled stock cube and water (or liquid stock, if you prefer). Snap the lasagna sheets into bite-sized pieces, and add them to the pan, mixing well.

# Bring the mixture to a simmer, and cook for around 15 minutes, or until the pasta is just cooked. Make sure you stir regularly to stop the pasta sheets from sticking together. Then add the pesto and cream, and bring to a gentle simmer.

# Mix well, and add the fresh mozzarella, torn into bite-sized chunks. Stir the cheese into the hot soup.

# Serve the lasagna soup while the mozzarella is gooey but still holding its shape. I garnished mine with some fresh basil.
