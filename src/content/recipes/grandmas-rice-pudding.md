<<<
Grandma used to use this recipe for leftover rice. Feel free to do that, or make rice just for the pudding!

Elsie Florence Stadtler was born on May 25, 1920. She married Otto Arthur Saidat in May of 1939. Their first son, Richard Burton Saidat was born in July 1939. Next came Donald Arthur Saidat in February 1943. Finally, twins David Ray and Dennis Jay Saidat were born on 25 July 1956.

She completed high school in 1938. She was a dancer while she grew up. Her father left the family in the 30's, and her family moved in with her mother's parents in Chicago. Elsie had an older brother, Paul, and her mother was Adele Hoeller. Adele eventually remarried and was known as "Grandma Vito".

David married Catherine Elizabeth Marchenko in January of 1976. Amanda Christine Saidat was born 28 June 1976. She married Mark David Aumann on 30 May 1999. They had Abigail, Mykola, Suzanne, and Theresa.

## Ingredients
For each 1/2 cup of cooked rice, use:

* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 T sugar

You'll also need:

* vanilla
* salt
* raisins (opt., about 1 T per 1/2 cup of rice)
* chopped nuts (opt.)

## Directions

# Combine the egg(s) and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir into the rice in a cold pot and add the raisins.
# Turn the heat to medium-low and start heating, stirring constantly.
# When it gets warm, stir in the sugar and some salt (no more than 1/2 teaspoon for the whole pot).
# Continue cooking and stirring until the liquid starts getting thick and setting. You'll know it's done when you dip a metal spoon into it and it costs the back of the spoon without running.
# Remove from the heat and stir in some vanilla (about 1/2-1 teaspoon) and nuts (about 1 T per serving).
# Portion into dessert bowls and refrigerate for serving, or eat warm with cinnamon on top.
