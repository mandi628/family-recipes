# Uzvar Liquid

Uzvar is an ancient Ukrainian drink made of mixed dried fruits.

Classic combination is apples, pears and smoked prunes. But of course you can use any fruits that you like. Just avoid the fruits that were soaked in sugar syrup.

Uzvar has natural subtle sweet taste and is pleasant to drink like it is. But feel free to add your favorite sweetener. If you have vegan honey on hand that would be perfect.

Also you can make it spicy by adding cinnamon sticks, star anise and cloves. Spicy Uzvar is the best when served hot.

Cook time: 22 minutes; plus overnight steeping

* 5 cups mixed dried fruits (apples, pears, prunes, etc.)
* 3 liters water

# Wash your dried fruits if they have dust on them.
# Put fruits in a big pot and cover with 3 liters of water. Bring to a boil.
# Lower the heat and let it simmer covered for 20 minutes.
# Switch off the heat and set aside for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
# Strain the liquid and serve. Can be served hot or cold, with your favorite sweetener, if desired.
