# Holly Glob Cookies

<<<
The tradition of these cookies started in the late 1980s, when Oma (Cathy (Marchenko) Saidat) found the recipe in a Family Circle Magazine. It originally called for shaping the cookies into rings to make wreaths, but this proved too complicated for us, and the cookies ended up being "globs", so we kept it that way. We've continued to make these cookies every year since, and it's not Christmas without them!
