# Original Greek Cold Cream

* 1/8 tsp borax powder
* 1/4 cup distilled water
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 2 tbsp grated beeswax
* 1 tsp rosewater (optional)

# Dissolve the borax in the water in a glass measuring cup and set aside.
# Mix together the oil and beeswax in another glass measuring cup and place in a pan of water (about 1-2"), making a water bath.
# Heat the oil-beeswax mixture in the water bath over medium heat until the beeswax is melted (8-10 minutes), stirring occasionally.
# When the wax is melted, bring the borax-water mixture almost to boiling - microwave on High for 1 minute, or use another water bath.
# Remove the oil-beeswax mixture from the water bath. Slowly add the borax-water mixture to it, stirring briskly.
# As the mixture cools, add the rosewater and stir well.
# Pour the cooled cream into a clean container with a lid. It will thicken as it cools.

To use: Massage a small amount into your skin and tissue off or rise off with warm water.
