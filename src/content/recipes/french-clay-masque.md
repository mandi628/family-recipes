# French Clay Masque

* 1 tbsp clay powder ^^1^^
* 2-3 tsp distilled water

# In a small ceramic bowl, mix together the clay and water, adding the water one teaspoon at a time until you have a smooth paste.
# With your fingers, apply the clay mask all over your face and neck, avoiding the eye area.
# Let the mask dry for about 20 minutes.
# Wash the mask off with warm water, followed by a cold water rise. Allow your pores to close completely and apply moisturizer.

^^1^^ You can use the same clay used for [Clay Hair Wash](Clay Hair Wash.html).
