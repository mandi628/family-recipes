* 1 part rice
* 2 parts liquid

Stir together the rice and liquid and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and let set 15-20 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed.

Parts can be 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup, 1 cup, etc. Generally, 1/4 cup rice person is recommended.

* For **plain rice**, use water.

Generally, you want to use water-based liquids to cook the rice. You can make a [Hot Rice Cereal](Hot Rice Cereal.html) by cooking the rice in milk, with a handful of raisins or other dried fruits. Sweeten with sugar, maple syrup, or honey. NOTE: You would not boil the milk for this one. Keep the heat at medium.
