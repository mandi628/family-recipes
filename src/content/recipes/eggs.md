# Eggs

Here are some notes on various way to cook eggs.

## Boiled Eggs^^1^^

Personally, I like them soft- or medium-boiled. But these tips will help you get the perfect eggs every time.

Boiling eggs is best with older, store-bought eggs. Some articles recommended aging them about a week, but store-bought eggs are sometimes up to a month old before we get them.

### Directions
# Place the desired number of eggs in a pot.
# Pour enough cold water into the pot to cover the eggs by about an inch.
# Turn on the heat to boil the water.
# Once the water boils, remove the pot from the heat and cover with a lid. Leave the eggs in the water
#* 4 minutes for liquid yolks
#* 6 minutes for soft set yolks
#* 8 minutes for medium set yolks
#* 10 minutes for hard set yolks
# Using a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the eggs from the water, place them in an in-water bath for 10-15 minutes, or longer.
# Peel and enjoy. They can be stored in the fridge for up to one week.

## Steamed Eggs^^2^^

This method works great for farm-fresh eggs.

### Directions
# Place the eggs in a colander in the bottom of a large pot.
# Add about 1-2 inches of cold water to the pot, but don't let the water touch the eggs.
# Turn the pot on high to start boiling the water.
# Once the water boils, reduce the heat and cover the pot to keep the steam inside. Steam them for
#* 6-8 minutes for soft cooked
#* 8-12 minutes for medium cooked
#* 12-15 minutes for hard cooked
# Place the eggs in an ice bath for 10-15 minutes, or more.
# Peel and enjoy! They can be stored in the fridge, unpeeled, for up to a week.
