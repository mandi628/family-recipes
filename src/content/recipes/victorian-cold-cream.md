# Victorian Cold Cream

## Ingredients

* 1 part beeswax (ex. 7g)
* 4 parts almond oil (ex. 28g) - you can use other oils as well: coconut, jojoba, etc.
* 2-4 parts rosewater or rosewater hydrosol (14-28g)

* (opt.) 1/8-1/4 tsp borax, dissolved in the rosewater (borax can help stabilize the emulsification)

### Rosewater

#### Method 1 - Rosewater

* rose petals
* tap water

Fill pint jars with rose petals. Fill the jars with water, cover and refrigerate for 2-3 days, stirring every 12 hours. Store in refrigerator.

#### Method 2 - Rosewater hydrosol

* rose petals
* tap water
* ice

Place a small-medium mixing bowl upside down inside a large pot. Place another bowl right side up on top of it. Place a ring of fresh rose petals around the bowls and fill with cold water. Place the pot lid upside down on top of the pot and fill it with ice. Place the pot on medium-low heat and boil/simmer for 1 hour, making sure to keep water in the pot. The rosewater hydrosol will collect in the small bowl inside the pot.

## Cold Cream Directions

Melt the beeswax and oil in a double boiler. Gradually add the rosewater, beating constantly, until emulsified. Remove from heat and continue stirring as the mixture cools, maintaining emulsification.

Store in the refrigerator. Use as you would use any cold cream.
