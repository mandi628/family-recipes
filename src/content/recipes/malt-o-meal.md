# Malt-O-Meal

<<<
The box includes instructions for making it, but here is what I like to do.
<<<

For one serving:  


* 3 Tbsp Malt-O-Meal cereal
* 1 cup water, milk, or a combination of the two
* Dash of salt

# Place in a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 1 minute, then stir.
# Heat for 30 seconds, and stir.
# Heat for 30 seconds more, and stir.
# Heat for 30 seconds more, watching to make sure it doesn't boil over. When done, remove from microwave, stir, and add in any desired toppings: more milk, butter, maple syrup, brown sugar, fruits, nuts, etc.
