!Bigus

This recipe has been a favorite in the family for a couple of generations. Originally a Polish dish, Bigus is a hunter's stew and has many variations. I've included the most basic instructions here, with add-in ideas at the end. This is the way I make it...

* 1 stick butter
* 1 onion, sliced thin
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 head cabbage, shredded
* 1 jar sauerkraut, rinsed & drained (very dry)
* 1 lb. Polish sausage, sliced (circles or half circles) - leave out for vegetarian version

# Turn the oven to 300. Place the butter in a roasting pan and put it in the oven.
# Slice the onion and add to the pan when the butter is melted. Bake for 30 minutes.
# Once the onions are cooked, stir in the garlic and cabbage. Salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 30 minutes.
# When the cabbage is wilted and bright green, stir in the sauerkraut. Salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 30 minutes.
# The cabbage should start turning a golden color at this point. Go ahead and add the sausage and bake another 30 minutes.
# Continue stirring every 30 minutes. The cabbage and sauerkraut should be the same color when it's done. Taste it for salt and pepper, and adjust, if needed.

!!Add-ins
You can add any root vegetables, really, and you can even continue to add to it after the initial meal.

* Shredded carrots
* Chopped mushrooms
* Chopped bacon (use it instead of the butter at the beginning)

You can also adjust the ratio of cabbage to sauerkraut, or reduce quantities for smaller batches, or increase the amount of sausage.

For **vegetarian** Bigus, try adding chopped apples or pears, and other cold weather veggies, like broccoli.
