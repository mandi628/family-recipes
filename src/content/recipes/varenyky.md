# Varenyky

<<<
This recipe is one that works for us, but there are a ton of variations online, and at least three different types in the *Traditional Ukrainian Cookery* cookbook. I will add them as time allows so you can find what works for you.

* 2 cups flour
* 3/4 cups hot tap water
* [filling](Varenyky & Pyrohy Fillings.html)

# Place flour in a food processor.
# Slowly add water, pulsing as you go.
# When dough comes together, remove from the food processor. If you're mixing the dough by hand, stir the water into the dough in a bowl until it comes together, then continue.
# On a floured board, knead the dough a few times to bring it together.
# Cut the dough into 4 parts and cover with a damp towel to keep it from drying out.
# Heat a pot of salted water on the stove on medium-high so it's boiling when you're ready.
# Take one section of the dough, and roll into a snake. Cut the snake into 12 equal-ish pieces. With a rolling pin, roll out each piece into a circle, flouring as needed to keep it from sticking.
# Holding the circle in your palm, lace 2-3 tsp of filling in the center of the circle. Dip your finger into a cup of water and wet the edge of the dough. Fold it over and pinch the edges together, keeping the filling in the middle.
# At this point, you have two options. You can make all the varenyky, covering them with a damp towel, then boil them in groups of 6-8. Or, you can place them in the boiling water as you make them.
# If you plan to freeze them, boil them for about 2-3 minutes, then place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, not touching. Place the cookie sheet in the freezer until they are frozen solid (about 2 hours), then put them in Ziploc bags for longer storage. When you're ready to eat them, boil them 3-5 minutes, then toss with melted butter and serve with sour cream.
# If you plan to eat them immediately, boil them for about 3-5 minutes, then place them in a bowl with some butter and toss them as you go. Serve with sour cream.
