!Single-Ingredient Masks from Nature's Skin Salon

**Avacado**: Soften rough, drys kin with a mashed avacado. The unsaturated fatty acids of the alligator pear stimulate your skin's own natural production of oil (this is not for oily skin).

**Egg**: Eggs are great for your skin. The whites are very astringent and drying, and the yolks are rich in natural moisturizers. Egg yolks are a major source of lecithin, a natural emollient and preservative.

**Plain Yogurt**: Rich in protein, calcium, and vitamins, yogurt makes an excellent mask for all skin types. Yogurt is easily absorbed into the skin and has super softening qualities.

**Strawberries**: Strawberries contain salicylic acid (found in aspirin), which rids the skin of dead cells, allowing it to absorb moisture more efficiently.

**Banana**: Bananas are great for dry skin because they are rich in potassium and vitamin A. They also contain no substances known to aggravate the skin.

**Cucumber**: Grated cucumbers make a gentle and milk astringent mask. It is especially soothing for sunburned skin.

**Mayonnaise**: [Mayonnaise](Mayonnaise.html) has it all - oil, eggs, and vinegar. It is naturally soothing to the skin, and improves skin texture. Mayonnaise is hard to beat for the conditioning power it provides.

**Pear**: Pears are a good source of sorbitol; other fruits that contain a high amount are apples, cherries, plums, and berries. Sorbitol is a humectant that gives a smooth feeling to your skin. Pears are especially soothing for red, blotchy skin. Apply either the fresh juice or the mashed fruit on your face.

**Tomato**: Tomatoes are effective on blackheads and oily skin. The juice of the tomato has astringent properties that help remove dead skin cells and deep-clean the skin's surface.
