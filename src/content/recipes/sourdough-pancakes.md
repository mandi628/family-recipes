!Sourdough Pancakes

* 2 cups flour, [spooned and leveled](Sifting Flour.html)
* 1 cup [sourdough discard](Sourdough Starter.html)

If you don't have a full cup of starter, you can half the recipe.

* 1 cup flour
* 1/2 cup [sourdough discard](Sourdough Starter.html)
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 3/4 to 1 cup milk
* 1 large egg
* 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1/2 tsp salt

# Preheat your skillet over medium-low heat for 15 minutes
# Combine all your ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to combine. Lumps are ok.
# Melt some butter or oil in your skillet
# Add batter to pan and cook until edges are dry and surface is bubbly. **Author suggests 1/2 cup of batter per pancake, I like 1/4 cup.**
# Flip the pancake and cook another 2-3 minutes
# Serve immediately.

NOTE: I like pancake batter to be thick, but this was too thick for me. I ended up adding a little more milk, but it will also depend on the thickness of your starter. I also like them a little sweeter, so I added a little extra sugar.
