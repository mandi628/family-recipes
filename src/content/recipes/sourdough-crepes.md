# Sourdough Crepes
Cook time: 11 minutes  

Servings: 4

* 1/2 cup sourdough discard
* 3 Tbsp melted butter
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup milk
* 2 Tbsp water
* 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
* 3 Tbsp granulated sugar (optional)
* 1 Tbsp melted butter or fat for cooking

# Whisk the ingredients together (except fat for cooking) in a large mixing bowl. Let rest for 1 hour in the fridge.
# Heat a lightly greased, non-stick skillet over medium heat.
# Pour ¼ cup of the batter into the skillet and tilt the skillet in a circular motion to distribute the batter into a thin, even layer. Cook until the sides of the batter start to fold back from the skillet and the bottom starts to turn golden brown. About 60-90 seconds.
# Gently turn the crepe over using a large spatula. Cook on the second side for 30-60 seconds or until golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter. Keep the crepes warm after they cook by stacking them on a baking sheet in a preheated 350°F (176°C) oven until ready to serve.

### Notes
* If using whole wheat flour, more liquid may be needed to thin the batter. Add a tablespoon at a time, after it has rested "if needed" to get correct consistency. It should be very thin.
* Store crepes stacked between layers of parchment or wax paper, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap or freezer bag. Keep in the fridge for up to 7 days or in freezer for up to 2 months.
* Thaw in fridge before reheating in a skillet over medium heat.
