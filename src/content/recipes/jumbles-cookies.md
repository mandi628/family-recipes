!Jumbles Cookies

<<<
I originally found this recipe in an M&M cook book for cooking with the "new" M&M minis. The book was from the late 1990's, or early 2000's. I was not able to find information about the book online, and I no longer have the book. So here is what I have from my notes and my memory.

As I recall, the description of the recipe said something along the lines of, "all the goodies with just enough dough to hold them all together."
<<<

* 1 stick butter, softened
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1-1/4 cup flour
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 pkg M&M mini baking bits (can be replaced with chocolate chips or 12 ox. of regular M&Ms)
* 1 cup raisins
* 1 cup chopped walnuts

# Cream butter and sugars with an electric mixer.
# Add egg and beat 1 minutes more.
# Add flour and baking soda, using mixer at first, then by hand, if needed.
# With wooden spoon, stir in M&Ms, rasins, and walnuts.
# Spoon onto cookie sheets and bake at 375 for 9-11 minutes.
