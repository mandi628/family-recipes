* 1-1/2 cups pecans, toasted and chopped
* 1-1/2 cups vegetable oil
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 4 large eggs
* 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground ginger
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3 cups grated carrot

### For the Cream Cheese Frosting
* 8 oz. cream cheese
* 3/4 cup unsalted butter (if using salted better, reduce salt to 1/8 tsp)
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 5 cups powdered sugar

## Instructions
# Preheat oven to 350F and butter two 8-inch round cake pans, and place a circle of parchment paper at the bottom of each pan.
# Spread the pecans out on an ungreased baking sheet and toast in the oven for 10-15 minutes. Let cool before chopping.
# In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract.
# Whisk in the spices. Then, add the salt and baking soda, making sure to get it will incorporated.
# Add the flour, and fold it in gently.
# Blend the batter just until there are no dry pockets of flour left, but don't over mix the batter.
# Finally, fold in the shredded carrots and toasted pecans.
# Take care to get all the chunky bits evenly incorporated. The batter will be thick.
# Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans, and bake for about 35-40 minutes, until risen and the cakes spring back when lightly touched. Allow them to cool fully at room temperature before frosting.

### For the frosting
# Add the cream cheese, butter, salt, and vanilla to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse/process until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
# Add the powdered sugar, about 2 cups at a time, processing between each addition until smooth.
# Once the cake layers are fully cooled, frost with the cream cheese frosting and store any leftovers in the fridge.
