# Never-Fail Medivnyk

<<<
The book has several types of medivnyk, since it is a very popular dessert in Ukraine. This one looked the least intimidating, so I thought I'd give it a try. The individual recipes don't specify how long they need to cure before serving, but the section title says all medivnyks need to cure a few days. Plan to make it ahead of time.

This honey cake is a great use of honey. The Ukrainian word for honey is "med".
<<<

* 1 cup honey
* 3 cups [sifted flour](Sifting Flour.html)
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup strong cool coffee (I used instant)
* grated rind and juice of 1 orange (I used 2 mandarin oranges, since that's what I had)
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 2 Tbsp butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 4 eggs, separated
* 1 cup chopped walnuts

# Bring the honey to a boil and then cool it.
# Sift the flour with the dry ingredients twice.
# Combine the coffee with the grated rind, orange juice, and vanilla.
# Cream the butter with the sugar. Mix in the honey.
# Beat the egg yolks until light and blend with the honey mixture. Add the flour alternately with the coffee.
# Stir in the nuts.
# Beat the egg whites until stiff and fold into the batter. Spoon into a buttered baking pan.
# Bake in a moderate oven (325F) for about 50 minutes, or until done when tested (toothpick in center comes out clean).
# Remove the cake from the pan and place it on a cake rack.

NOTE: This recipe made a lot of batter. I used one bread loaf pan, but it really should have been divided into two. 2023.12.28 ama
