# Sourdough Biscuits
Time: 50 minutes  

Makes 8-10 biscuits  


### Ingredients
* 2 cups flour
* 2 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 3/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, frozen (one stick)^^1^^
* 1 cup active [sourdough starter](Sourdough Starter.html)
* 1/2 cup buttermilk^^2^^

### Steps
# Preheat oven to 450. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
# In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.
# Grate the butter with the large holes on a cheese grater and stir into the flour mixture.
# In a smaller bowl, whisk together the sourdough starter and buttermilk. Add to the flour mixture and stir together with a spatula until a soft dough forms.
# On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 2-3 times. Roll out to about 1-1/2 inches thick. Cut out 8-10 rounds with a 2" cutter (glass, cookie cutter, etc.). ''If you can't fit 8-10, mush the dough together and roll again - just be careful not to work it too much or the biscuits get tough.''^^3^^
# Place the biscuits on the baking sheet and bake 14-18 minutes.
# Serve warm.

^^1^^ If using salted butter, reduce salt to 3/4 tsp.  

^^2^^ If you don't have buttermilk, use regular milk with a splash of vinegar or lemon juice stirred in - give it a minute to curdle. You can also just use regular milk or evaporated milk, but it will give it a milder flavor.  

^^3^^ If the dough is too wet and you can't cut circles, just use a butter knife and cut it into squares. No one ever said biscuits **have** to be circles.
