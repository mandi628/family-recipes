# Tacos or Burritos

This one seems like kind of a no-brainer, but I wanted to include it as a great idea for any weeknight meal.

For **Nachos**, simply assemble everything on top of your favorite tortilla chips.

* 1 C TVP (or ground meat, omit the broth/water)
* 1 C preferred broth or water
* 3-4 T [taco seasoning](Taco Seasoning.html)
* 1/3 C water
* taco shells or [tortillas](Tortillas.html)
* lettuce
* tomatoes
* salsa
* avocado
* sour cream
* taco sauce
* refried beans

**Vegetarian version**

Rehydrate the TVP with broth or water for 10 minutes. Once rehydrated, place in a small saucepan and add the taco seasoning and water. Heat to a simmer and simmer for 5-10 minutes, until sauce is reduced.

If desired, you can saute some diced onions and green peppers while the TVP is rehydrating, and stir them in when you combine with seasoning.

**Meat version**

Brown the ground meat (with or without oil), drain, then return to the pan and add the taco seasoning and water. Simmer 5-10 minutes, until sauce is reduced.

If desired, you can saute some diced onions and green pepper while browning the meat.

**Both versions**

While "meat" is cooking, warm the shells or tortillas in the microwave with a damp towel. Shred the lettuce, dice the tomatoes and avocado.

For tacos, assemble as desired and enjoy.

For burritos, layer ingredients in the center of the tortillas. Fold front portion over the filling, fold in ends, then roll snugly. Place in a dry pan with the ends down and toast on both sides to seal.
