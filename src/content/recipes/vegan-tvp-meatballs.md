# Vegan TVP Meatballs

Time: 25 min
Servings: 10 meatballs

## Ingredients
* 1 C TVP (textured vegetable protein)
* 7/8 C vegetable broth
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp Italian seasoning
* 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1/4 C flour or breadcrumbs
* salt & pepper, to taste

## Directions
# Bring veggie broth to a boil and pour over tvp. Cover and allow to sit for 10 minutes until completely absorbed. (A beef-flavored broth, such as the Better than Bouillon No Beef Base, will make these taste more convincing.)
# Add the remaining ingredients and combine into a thick dough that holds together. Depending on the type of flour you use, you may need to add extra.
# Add salt as needed, depending on whether the broth and Italian seasoning contain salt.
# Shape mixture into 1-2″ balls.
# To bake, cook in preheated 400°F for 20 minutes.
# To pan-fry, heat a few tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry meatballs for 5-8 minutes, tilting the pan to roll them around and brown.
