!Lentil Quinoa Salad

2 servings; 27 minutes

## Ingredients

### Salad
* 1/4 C quinoa (uncooked)
* 1/2 C red lentils (uncooked)
* 8 whole almonds, chopped
* 6 green olives
* 2 handfuls baby spinach
* 1/3 tsp chili flakes, to taste
* slat and pepper to taste
* 1/2 avocado, diced
* 1-1/3 C vegetable broth (or water with salt)

!!!Dressing
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 2 tsp maple syrup (or honey)
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
* salt to taste

## Directions
# Rinse and drain the quinoa and red lentils. Add both to a pot with double the amount of water and a bit of salt or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then set to low heat. Simmer for 15-17 minutes, until all water is absorbed / evaporated. Cover and let the mix steam for 5 minutes.
# In a medium-sized bowl, mix the quinoa, lentils, chopped almonds, chopped green olives, torn baby spinach leaves, chili flakes, and black pepper/salt to taste until incorporated. Then fold in the diced avocado gently, to avoid smashing it.
# In a small bowl or plate, mix the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup and salt.
# Serve the lentil quinoa salad with the dressing and enjoy.

### Make Ahead
Store the salad in 2 containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
