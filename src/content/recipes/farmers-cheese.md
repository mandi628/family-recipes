# Farmer's Cheese
## Homemade Ricotta Cheese

Yields: 4 C cheese

* 1 gallon whole milk (raw or pasteurized is ok)
* 1/4 C butter (optional), or 1 quart heavy cream
* 1 C vinegar
* 1 T salt (optional)

# Heat the milk to about 120 degrees.
# Stir in the vinegar.
# Let sit 15-20 minutes, until the whey is mostly clear.
# Line a sieve or strainer with cheesecloth or a fine/thin towel
# Scoop out the curds into the strainer. Continue scooping until all the solids are out of the whey.
# Save the whey to use in [Sourdough Starter](Sourdough Starter.html), [Sourdough Bread](Sourdough Bread.html), or any other batter recipes you want. You can also use it as the souring agent in [Borscht](Borscht.html).
# Pull up the corners of the cheesecloth and tighten on the curds. Tie a string around the ends of the cloth to tighten it on the curds. Hang over the sink for about 1 hour.
# Knead the salt into the cheese before placing in a storage container.

!!NOTES
* Use this in [Cheese Fritters](Cheese Fritters.html), [Varenyky](Varenyky.html), make [cream cheese](Cream Cheese.html), or as a spread on toast.
* Adding butter or heavy cream gives a higher yield.
