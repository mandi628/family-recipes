# Mediterranean Baked White Fish

Yields: 6 servings

## Ingredients
* 1 ½ lb white fish fillet such as cod or halibut, (1 to 1 ½ in thickness)
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Juice of ½ lemon more for later
* 8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved
* 3 ounces pitted olives, halved (I used a combination of kalamata olives and green olives)
* 3 tablespoons minced red onion
* 4 to 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano

## Directions
# Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.
# Pat the fish dry and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Brush a 9 ½ x 13-inch baking dish with a little extra virgin olive oil and put the fish in it. Squeeze ½ lemon juice all over the top of the fish.
# In a medium mixing bowl, combine the tomatoes, olives, onions, garlic and spices. Add a very small pinch of salt and ground pepper. Add a generous drizzle (about 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil) toss to combine.
# Pour the tomato and olive mixture over the fish.
# Bake in the heated oven for 15 to 20 minutes (this will depend on the thickness of your fish).
# Remove from the heat and serve.
