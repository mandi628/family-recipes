# Vegan Burger Patty

Makes 6 patties

* 1 C TVP
* 1 C vegan beef broth (or veggie broth)
* 2 T nutritional yeast
* 2 T mushroom seasoning (or 2 tsp miso paste)
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/4 C vegan mayo (or neutral oil)
* 1 T black strap molasses
* 1 T soy sauce (or tamari)
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 tsp Gravy Master (optional, for color)
* 1/2 tsp Liquid Smoke
* 2 T ground flaxseed
* 1/4 C all-purpose flour
* 1/4-1/2 C breadcrumbs

# Rehydrate the TVP in the broth for about 10 minutes.
# While the TVP rehydrates, add everything but the flour and breadcrumbs to a bowl and stir to combine (you can also use clean hands to mix it) to make the marinade mixture.
# Once TVP is rehydrated, add the marinade mixture to the TVP and combine with clean hands or a spoon/spatula. Add in the flour and breadcrumbs, and combine once again.
# A quick note on bread crumbs, I recommend using finer bread crumbs over Panko. Start with 1/4-1/2 cup worth and add more as needed.
# The mixture should come together easily and form a big meatball. You can make a quick patty and toss it from hand to hand to make sure it won't fall apart.
# You can also make a slider patty and fry it up to test out the seasoning if you wish, and then adjust as needed after tasting.
# Form patties to preferred size; I recommend 2 oz. for a thin smash style patty, 4 oz. for a normal sized patty.
# To cook, simply get a pan up to medium heat, add some oil and cook on each side for about 3-4 minutes or until nicely browned. Season as you like! When you flip the patty, add a slice of vegan cheese, then a little water to the pan. Cover to stead and melt the cheese, and then load up a bun with all the fixings!
