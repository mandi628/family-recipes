# Alfredo Sauce

This traditional Alfredo sauce can be used on pasta, [Italian Mac & Cheese](Italian Mac & Cheese.html), pizza - you name it. If fresh Parmesan cheese is a challenge, try this [Alfredo Sauce on a Budget](Alfredo Sauce on a Budget.html) recipe instead.

Yields: 8 servings

## Ingredients
* 6 T unsalted butter (salted butter is okay, too)
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1-1/2 C heavy cream, room temperature (you can substitute milk with some melted butter in it, if necessary - 1 T butter to 1 C milk)
*6.4 oz. freshly grated Parmesan cheese
*salt, to taste
* ground black pepper, to taste
* minced fresh thyme, optional

## Directions
# Melt the butter in a medium saucepan on medium heat.
# Add the garlic and cook until lightly browned and fragrant.
# Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for 3-5 minutes.
# Pour in the room temperature heavy cream. Whisk until combined.
# Once the cream is fully combined, place the pan back on the stove over low heat. Do not let the sauce come to a boil - keep it over low heat.
# Add the grated cheese and continually whisk the sauce together until the cheese is completely melted and evenly combined.
# Taste and season with salt, pepper, and thyme.
# Serve or use immediately.
