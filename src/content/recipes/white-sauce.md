# White Sauce

Many sauces use a similar formula. What makes them different is what you put in it. The basic formula for any sauce is:

* 1 T fat
* 1 T starch (flour or cornstarch, usually)
* 1 C liquid

You melt the fat, stir in the starch and cook it a little, then gradually whisk in the liquid. You can make it thicker by increasing the fat and starch. You make it thinner by increasing the liquid. Here are the details for a good white sauce.

## Ingredients
* 1 T butter or shortening
* 1 T all-purpose flour (white or wheat)
* 1 C milk (whole milk works well because of the fat content)
* 1/2 - 1 tsp salt
* 1/4-1/2 tsp ground pepper
* herbs of choice
* 1/2 tsp sugar, optional (a lot of Southern cuisine calls for this)

## Directions
# In a small saucepan, melt the butter.
# Sprinkle in the flour and stir until smooth. Continue stirring over medium-low to medium heat for about 2 minutes.
#* You can continue to cook it until it starts to turn brown, which is signature in some cuisines.
# Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly. I like to pour a little at a time, stirring in between until it's smooth. You can also do it in a trickle, stirring constantly.
# Once all the milk is poured in, stir in your seasonings and herbs.
# Continue cooking and stirring until thickened. Do NOT boil.
# Use as desired.
