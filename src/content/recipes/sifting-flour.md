# Sifting Flour

When a recipe calls for sifted flour, the question always comes up, "Do you measure it before or after sifting?"  


According to [American's Test Kitchen](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated/how_tos/5515-the-right-time-to-sift#:~:text=Does%20it%20really%20matter%20if,should%20be%20sifted%20after%20measuring..html)^^1^^, it depends on how the directions are worded.  


* If the instructions say "1 cup sifted flour", for example, sift the flour first, then measure it.
* If the instructions day "1 cup flour, sifted", then measure the flour first, and sift it after measuring.

When a recipe calls for flour to be "spooned and leveled", you spoon the flour into the measuring cup, then scrape the top off with a butter knife, instead of just scooping it from the container. This allows the flour to unpack and measure more accurately.^^2^^
