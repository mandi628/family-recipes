Please view my soap making safety video here and read my disclaimer here.\n\nThis recipe uses the paste method for liquid soap making whereby an initial soap paste is made and completely saponified (turned to soap) before dilution for use in pump bottles or other containers. \n\n!!Soap Paste Ingredients \n\n**500g olive oil**  \n\nI have noticed that my liquid soap is thicker if I use extra virgin olive oil. I have to do some more rigorous testing to see if this is truly the case, but it seems to be! Any type of olive oil will work for this recipe, I used semi-refined olive oil for the video. \n\n**156g water**  \n\nDistilled or demineralised water is best (makes the clearest soap), but filtered, sanitised drinking water is also fine if it is a soft water type. \n\n**104g potassium hydroxide (KOH)**  \n\nMine is 90% purity. If you have a different strength, you’ll need to recalculate this recipe. This video shows you how I do it.\n\n**104g vegetable glycerine**  \n\nThis is an optional ingredient. If you don’t have glycerine you can replace it with another 104g water. \n\n*Be aware that glycerine acts as a solvent in this recipe and does wonders to accelerate saponification and prevent separation of oils and lye water as the soap paste is mixed and cooked. This recipe requires a lot more patience and stick blending without the glycerine, but it can be done! Glycerine also adds emollience and extra moisture to the recipe due to its humectant properties, so it’s great to use if you have it. *\n\n!!Dilution water\n\nYou will need between **1700g (1.7 litres) and 2100g (2.1 litres)** of distilled, demineralised or filtered tap water to dilute this full soap paste recipe. Start with 1700g and add more if needed (see video for discussion/demonstration). Note that if you use filtered tap water, your soap may not be perfectly translucent due to minerals in the water.\n\nYou can also dilute just a portion of this soap paste and store the remaining paste in the fridge for later dilution as I do in this video. Start with a dilution ratio of 1 part paste to 1.5 parts water (by weight) and add more water if needed.\n\n!!Other recipe specifications\n\nThe crock pot I used in the video is a small one, it holds 3 litres. If you don’t have a crock pot you can make this soap using a saucepan on the stove on very low heat, or use a double boiler. \n\nThis recipe is made with a 1% superfat, and does not require any additional ingredients to adjust the pH of the soap. See this video about my method for calculating liquid soap recipes for more details and rationale.\n\nThis recipe is calculated with a 1.5 : 1 water to lye ratio for the paste, however with the additional glycerine added (or water if you have no glycerine), the final water to lye ratio becomes 2.5 : 1.\n\nMy potassium hydroxide is 90% purity and the recipe is calculated to factor that in.\n\nThe recipe makes approximately 840g of soap paste and 2.7 litres of finished liquid soap. Your yield may be slightly more or less than mine, depending on evaporation during the cook. \n\n!!Salt solution for thickening\n\nThis is completely optional (I did not use any salt to thicken my soap in the video demonstration) but olive oil based liquid castile soap lends itself quite well to thickening with a 20% salt solution.\n\nIf you are using essential oils (see below) make sure you add those before you thicken the soap with a salt solution. Many essential oils thicken liquid soap by themselves, in which case further thickening with salt is not required.\n\nTo make the salt solution, mix 20g of non-iodised table salt with 80g of distilled (or otherwise purified) water and stir until fully dissolved.\n\nAdd the salt solution to completely cooled and diluted liquid soap, in small amounts (a teaspoon or less to start with), stir thoroughly and leave the soap to thicken for 30-60 minutes before checking. Be careful not to add too much, only slight thickening is recommended. Too much salt can inhibit the lather and will not thicken the soap beyond a certain point. Jackie Thompson in her book Liquid Soap Making (ad link) recommends adding no more than 1% salt solution of the total diluted soap amount (for example, if you have 500g of diluted liquid soap, you would add no more than 5g of 20% salt solution). \n\n!!Essential oils\n\nI did not add any essential oils to my Liquid Castile Soap in the video demonstration, however I usually add essential oils as I decant this soap into individual bottles to use around my household. \n\nI like to use 1-2% essential oils in my finished liquid soap. To calculate this I multiply the weight of the diluted soap (in grams) by 0.01 (1%), 0.015 (1.5%) or 0.02 (2%) to get the amount of essential oil needed, in grams.\n\nIf you would like to fragrance your liquid soap using synthetic fragrance oils, check the manufacturer’s suggested usage rates. If you aren’t sure I would start at 0.5-1% for fragrance oils. A little goes a long way in liquid soap!\n\nBe aware that some essential oils and fragrance oils can dramatically change the texture of liquid soap - some will thicken the soap, some will make it runny. Experiment with small amounts first to see how your oils react with your soap.\n\n!!METHOD\n\n*Please [view the video](https://youtu.be/Q-Ul8NNQZqg.html) for the full tutorial before you start.\n\n#Weigh the olive oil into your crock pot or slow cooker. Turn the cooker up to high to heat the oil. The soap will come together quite easily if the temperature is warm enough. Between 75°C/167°F and 80°C/176°F is ideal. If you do use the high temperature setting to heat your oil up faster (as I do), make sure you watch it closely and turn the cooker down to the low or ‘keep warm’ setting before it gets too hot. 85°C/185°F is the absolute maximum temperature for liquid soap making. Too much hotter and the soap will expand/volcano and will over-oxidise. \n\n#Wearing gloves and goggles for safety, weigh the potassium hydroxide into a small container, cover with a lid and set aside.\n\n#In a medium sized jug, weigh water for the lye solution and when you are ready (with your gloves and goggles on, and a mask if you are in an unventilated area) slowly pour the potassium hydroxide into the water, stirring to dissolve. Set aside somewhere safe.\n\n#Weigh the glycerine into a small bowl and set aside. \n\n#Get your stick blender ready and pour the dissolved lye solution into the warming oil. Start stirring and blending. Be very careful to keep the blades of your blender under the soap surface to avoid splashing. KEEP YOUR SAFETY GOGGLES ON THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS.\n\n#Add the glycerine soon after mixing the lye solution into the oils. \n\n#Keep an eye on the temperature (see point 1) and stick blend your soap batter off and on between manual stirring, to give your blender a rest, for about 10 minutes or until it thickens to a uniform, thick pudding consistency (see video).\n\n#Cover the soap, turn your cooker down to low or ‘keep warm’ and leave it to cook for 30 minutes or until it becomes glossy and translucent. \n\n#Test the soap paste with pH paper and check it with a clarity test, as demonstrated in the video. If the soap is cooked and fully saponified, no lye remains and the soap paste is ready to dilute.\n\n#Weigh the dilution water. Start with approximately two times the weight of the paste and add more later if needed. \n\n#Add dilution water to the soap pot, cover and let it sit for a few hours on low heat. You can stick blend the soap as I did in the video once it is at least half diluted. This helps it along in the final phase of the dilution.\n\n#Once your soap is diluted and cooled down, if you see a skin forming on the top of the soap, more dilution water is needed. Add more water in small amounts until the soap no longer skins. \n\n#Cool the soap, add essential oils if desired, and pour into bottles for storage or immediate use around the house. A lot of liquid soap makers suggest sequestering the soap for a couple of weeks before use, however I never do this. As long as the soap is fully saponified (and the pH is tested properly) then I am happy using my liquid soap straight away. \n\n!!What about preservatives?\n\nI make my liquid soap for personal use around our household and do not use a preservative for my relatively small batches. This is a great article on the topic of whether or not to use a preservative in your liquid soap. Because I have never used a preservative, I cannot offer you any educated guidance on the topic. Make sure you do your own thorough research in this area, especially if you are giving or selling your liquid soap to others.\n\nSource: [Liquid Castile Soap - 100% Olive Oil Liquid Soap Recipe](https://www.ellyseveryday.com/ellys-everyday-blog/liquid-castile-soap-recipe-100-percent-olive-oil.html)  \n\nUpdated: 2025.08.01 ama","src/content/recipes/liquid-castile-soap.md","ae3c134edbfc7afd",{"html":1476,"metadata":1477},"\u003Cp>!Liquid Castile Soap – 100% Olive Oil Liquid Soap Recipe\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Please ensure you are familiar with the basics of soap making including safety requirements before you attempt this or any handmade soap recipe.

Jackie Thompson in her book Liquid Soap Making (ad link) recommends adding no more than 1% salt solution of the total diluted soap amount (for example, if you have 500g of diluted liquid soap, you would add no more than 5g of 20% salt solution).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>!!Essential oils\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I did not add any essential oils to my Liquid Castile Soap in the video demonstration, however I usually add essential oils as I decant this soap into individual bottles to use around my household.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I like to use 1-2% essential oils in my finished liquid soap. To calculate this I multiply the weight of the diluted soap (in grams) by 0.01 (1%), 0.015 (1.5%) or 0.02 (2%) to get the amount of essential oil needed, in grams.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you would like to fragrance your liquid soap using synthetic fragrance oils, check the manufacturer’s suggested usage rates. If you aren’t sure I would start at 0.5-1% for fragrance oils. A little goes a long way in liquid soap!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Be aware that some essential oils and fragrance oils can dramatically change the texture of liquid soap - some will thicken the soap, some will make it runny. Experiment with small amounts first to see how your oils react with your soap.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>!!METHOD\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>*Please \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Q-Ul8NNQZqg.html\">view the video\u003C/a> for the full tutorial before you start.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Weigh the olive oil into your crock pot or slow cooker. Turn the cooker up to high to heat the oil. The soap will come together quite easily if the temperature is warm enough. Between 75°C/167°F and 80°C/176°F is ideal. If you do use the high temperature setting to heat your oil up faster (as I do), make sure you watch it closely and turn the cooker down to the low or ‘keep warm’ setting before it gets too hot. 85°C/185°F is the absolute maximum temperature for liquid soap making. Too much hotter and the soap will expand/volcano and will over-oxidise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Wearing gloves and goggles for safety, weigh the potassium hydroxide into a small container, cover with a lid and set aside.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#In a medium sized jug, weigh water for the lye solution and when you are ready (with your gloves and goggles on, and a mask if you are in an unventilated area) slowly pour the potassium hydroxide into the water, stirring to dissolve. Set aside somewhere safe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Weigh the glycerine into a small bowl and set aside.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Get your stick blender ready and pour the dissolved lye solution into the warming oil. Start stirring and blending. Be very careful to keep the blades of your blender under the soap surface to avoid splashing. KEEP YOUR SAFETY GOGGLES ON THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Add the glycerine soon after mixing the lye solution into the oils.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Keep an eye on the temperature (see point 1) and stick blend your soap batter off and on between manual stirring, to give your blender a rest, for about 10 minutes or until it thickens to a uniform, thick pudding consistency (see video).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Cover the soap, turn your cooker down to low or ‘keep warm’ and leave it to cook for 30 minutes or until it becomes glossy and translucent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Test the soap paste with pH paper and check it with a clarity test, as demonstrated in the video. If the soap is cooked and fully saponified, no lye remains and the soap paste is ready to dilute.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Weigh the dilution water. Start with approximately two times the weight of the paste and add more later if needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Add dilution water to the soap pot, cover and let it sit for a few hours on low heat. You can stick blend the soap as I did in the video once it is at least half diluted. This helps it along in the final phase of the dilution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Once your soap is diluted and cooled down, if you see a skin forming on the top of the soap, more dilution water is needed. Add more water in small amounts until the soap no longer skins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>#Cool the soap, add essential oils if desired, and pour into bottles for storage or immediate use around the house. A lot of liquid soap makers suggest sequestering the soap for a couple of weeks before use, however I never do this. As long as the soap is fully saponified (and the pH is tested properly) then I am happy using my liquid soap straight away.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>!!What about preservatives?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I make my liquid soap for personal use around our household and do not use a preservative for my relatively small batches. This is a great article on the topic of whether or not to use a preservative in your liquid soap. Because I have never used a preservative, I cannot offer you any educated guidance on the topic. Make sure you do your own thorough research in this area, especially if you are giving or selling your liquid soap to others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Source: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ellyseveryday.com/ellys-everyday-blog/liquid-castile-soap-recipe-100-percent-olive-oil.html\">Liquid Castile Soap - 100% Olive Oil Liquid Soap Recipe\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Updated: 2025.08.01 ama\u003C/p>",{"headings":1478,"localImagePaths":1479,"remoteImagePaths":1480,"frontmatter":1481,"imagePaths":1483},[],[],[],{"title":1467,"tags":1482,"created":1470,"modified":1471},[1469,262],[],"liquid-castile-soap.md","lunches",{"id":1485,"data":1487,"body":1492,"filePath":1493,"digest":1494,"rendered":1495,"legacyId":1504},{"title":1488,"tags":1489,"created":1490,"modified":1491},"Lunches",[204],"20250814203309605","20250814203355597","\u003C\u003Clist-links \"[tag[Lunch]]\">>","src/content/recipes/lunches.md","5ccea58c5f501225",{"html":1496,"metadata":1497},"\u003Cp>&#x3C;&#x3C;list-links “[tag[Lunch]]”>>\u003C/p>",{"headings":1498,"localImagePaths":1499,"remoteImagePaths":1500,"frontmatter":1501,"imagePaths":1503},[],[],[],{"title":1488,"tags":1502,"created":1490,"modified":1491},[204],[],"lunches.md","malt-o-meal",{"id":1505,"data":1507,"body":1512,"filePath":1513,"digest":1514,"rendered":1515,"legacyId":1533},{"title":1508,"tags":1509,"created":1510,"modified":1511},"Malt-O-Meal",[131,608],"20240313163954537","20240313164101729","# Malt-O-Meal\n\n\u003C\u003C\u003C\nThe box includes instructions for making it, but here is what I like to do.\n\u003C\u003C\u003C\n\nFor one serving:  \n\n\n* 3 Tbsp Malt-O-Meal cereal\n* 1 cup water, milk, or a combination of the two\n* Dash of salt\n\n# Place in a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 1 minute, then stir.\n# Heat for 30 seconds, and stir.\n# Heat for 30 seconds more, and stir.\n# Heat for 30 seconds more, watching to make sure it doesn't boil over.

Some are cheap, some are expensive. But it's easy to start your own.  \n\n\n# In a clean jar that will hold at least 24 oz., stir together 1/2 cup flour^^1^^ and 1/2 cup warm water.^^2^^ Stir it well. Cover the jar with a clean cloth and a rubberband, and wait 24 hours.\n# Place 1/2 cup of your starter in a new jar, and add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup warm water. Stir it together well. Cover again and wait 24 hours. You can throw out the remaining starter from the first jar.\n# Repeat Step 2.\n# On the fourth day, you will repeat step 2, but only wait 12 hours before the next feeding. By now, you should notice bubbling in the starter. Continue feeding it every 12 hours.\n# After about 10 days, the starter should be strong enough to raise bread. You also want it to be relatively thick - it should be the consistency of thick glue. If it's not thick enough, add a little extra flour at the next feeding. If it's too thick, add a little extra water.^^4^^\n# When the starter gets to this point, you should be able to feed it every 24 hours again to maintain it.\n# Once you have enough activity, you can start using the discard for something like [Sourdough Pancakes](Sourdough Pancakes.html), [Sourdough Crepes](Sourdough Crepes.html), or [Sourdough Pizza Crust](Sourdough Pizza Crust.html). You can also measure off two portions of starter and setup two new jars. Keep one out to rise, and put the second one in the fridge.

Mama also has a worksheet on her computer that allows you to convert any bread recipe into a sourdough recipe.\n\n## Suggested Schedule\n* Feed the starter at least once a day, preferably in the morning.\n* In the morning, separate the starter into 1/2 cup for feeding, and 1/2 cup for proofing. Put the feeder in a jar and cover, as usual, and the proofer in a mixing bowl.\n* 12 hours later (in the evening), use the proofer as recommended in the [Sourdough Bread](Sourdough Bread.html) recipe. Add the flour, water, and salt and proof over night.\n* The next morning, feed your starter as normal, and place the proofer in the pan for the last rise. If you want, you can use the jarred starter to start proofing another loaf.\n* After 4 hours, bake your proofed bread as stated in the recipe.\n\nIf you want to find out more about sourdough, you can check out these websites that I go to regularly:  \n\n* [Sourdough Home](https://sourdoughhome.com.html)\n\n^^1^^ Some people swear by whole grain wheat flour or rye flour. I just used plain all-purpose white flour and had good results.  \n\n^^2^^ Some sources swear that tap water with chlorine will not work to start a starter. I have started with tap water with no problems, and I used spring water from the store. I honestly can't say if one was better than the other. The starter worked both ways.  \n\n^^3^^ To feed the backup jar, take it out the night before and let it come to room temperature. Do a regular feeding in the morning and leave it to rise. At night, do one more regular feeding, but put it back in the fridge.  \n\n^^4^^ I have found that sometimes the starter gets a little thin. That's ok - as long as it gets bubbly, it's still active. But if you want it to rise, it needs to be thicker. If it's getting thin, then short the water when feeding it. You can use as little as 1/4 cup.\n\n[Source](Sources.html): Aumann  \n\nUpdated: 2024.01.29 ama","src/content/recipes/sourdough-starter.md","0d0c7ce2c3b06af3",{"html":2816,"metadata":2817},"\u003Ch1 id=\"sourdough-starter\">Sourdough Starter\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>&#x3C;&#x3C;&#x3C;\nThese instructions will keep one cup of active starter on hand at all times.
