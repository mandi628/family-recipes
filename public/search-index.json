    "content": "\n!Alfredo Sauce on a Budget\n\nFresh Parmesan cheese can be expensive, but you can still have a nice white sauce for Alfredo dishes - over pasta, [Italian Mac & Cheese](Italian Mac & Cheese.html), on pizza, etc.\n\nThis recipe is similar to [Basic Cheese Sauce](Basic Cheese Sauce.html), just with a different flavor profile.\n\nYields: 4 servings\n\n!!Ingredients\n* 1/4 C butter (half a stick)\n* 3 T all-purpose flour\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 2-1/2 C milk (any amount of the milk can be substituted with heavy cream or half-and-half for a richer sauce)\n* 2 C shredded mozzarella cheese\n* 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning\n* 1/4 tsp black pepper\n\n!!Directions\n# Melt butter in a saucepan set over medium-low heat, then sprinkle in the flour. Whisk the mixture for two minutes, to prevent scorching.\n# Add minced garlic, and continue whisking until fragrant.\n# Increase the stovetop to medium heat and slowly add milk, while continuing to whisk, while continuing to whisk, to prevent lumps from forming. Continue until all of the milk has been added.\n# Melt cheese into the sauce a handful at a time. Repeat until all of the cheese has been added and has melted into a smooth sauce. Then, stir in the Italian seasoning and black pepper.\n# Check the consistency of the sauce. If it is too thin, let it simmer for a couple of minutes, until it thickens. If it is too thick, make sure the cheese has fully melted, then stir in a couple of splashes of milk, as needed.\n# Serve immediately over fettuccine pasta noodles.\n\nSource: [Alfredo Sauce Without Parmesan Cheese](https://www.foxvalleyfoodie.com/alfredo-sauce-without-parmesan-cheese/#recipe.html)  \n\nUpdated: 2025.09.08 ama"

I've included the most basic instructions here, with add-in ideas at the end. This is the way I make it...\n\n* 1 stick butter\n* 1 onion, sliced thin\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 head cabbage, shredded\n* 1 jar sauerkraut, rinsed & drained (very dry)\n* 1 lb. Polish sausage, sliced (circles or half circles) - leave out for vegetarian version\n\n# Turn the oven to 300. Place the butter in a roasting pan and put it in the oven.\n# Slice the onion and add to the pan when the butter is melted. Bake for 30 minutes.\n# Once the onions are cooked, stir in the garlic and cabbage. Salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 30 minutes.\n# When the cabbage is wilted and bright green, stir in the sauerkraut. Salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 30 minutes.\n# The cabbage should start turning a golden color at this point. Go ahead and add the sausage and bake another 30 minutes.\n# Continue stirring every 30 minutes. The cabbage and sauerkraut should be the same color when it's done. Taste it for salt and pepper, and adjust, if needed.\n\n!!Add-ins\nYou can add any root vegetables, really, and you can even continue to add to it after the initial meal.\n\n* Shredded carrots\n* Chopped mushrooms\n* Chopped bacon (use it instead of the butter at the beginning)\n\nYou can also adjust the ratio of cabbage to sauerkraut, or reduce quantities for smaller batches, or increase the amount of sausage.\n\nFor **vegetarian** Bigus, try adding chopped apples or pears, and other cold weather veggies, like broccoli.\n\nSource: Aumann, Mandi; Saidat, Cathy; Marchenko, Anna; Marchenko, Alla; Zalisko, Olga  \n\nUpdated: 2025.09.12 ama"

But these tips will help you get the perfect eggs every time.\n\nBoiling eggs is best with older, store-bought eggs. Some articles recommended aging them about a week, but store-bought eggs are sometimes up to a month old before we get them.\n\n### Directions\n# Place the desired number of eggs in a pot.\n# Pour enough cold water into the pot to cover the eggs by about an inch.\n# Turn on the heat to boil the water.\n# Once the water boils, remove the pot from the heat and cover with a lid. Leave the eggs in the water\n#* 4 minutes for liquid yolks\n#* 6 minutes for soft set yolks\n#* 8 minutes for medium set yolks\n#* 10 minutes for hard set yolks\n# Using a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the eggs from the water, place them in an in-water bath for 10-15 minutes, or longer.\n# Peel and enjoy. They can be stored in the fridge for up to one week.\n\n## Steamed Eggs^^2^^\n\nThis method works great for farm-fresh eggs.\n\n### Directions\n# Place the eggs in a colander in the bottom of a large pot.\n# Add about 1-2 inches of cold water to the pot, but don't let the water touch the eggs.\n# Turn the pot on high to start boiling the water.\n# Once the water boils, reduce the heat and cover the pot to keep the steam inside. Steam them for\n#* 6-8 minutes for soft cooked\n#* 8-12 minutes for medium cooked\n#* 12-15 minutes for hard cooked\n# Place the eggs in an ice bath for 10-15 minutes, or more.\n# Peel and enjoy! They can be stored in the fridge, unpeeled, for up to a week.\n\nSources:  \n\n^^1^^ [How to Boil an Egg](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-boil-an-egg/.html)   \n\n^^2^^ [The Easy Way to Peel Farm-Fresh Hard-Boiled Eggs](https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2014/04/the-easy-way-to-peel-farm-fresh-hard-boiled-eggs.html#:~:text=Paula%20M%20says,2016%20at%207:42%20am.html), The Prairie Homestead"

Her grandfather was a Ukrainian Orthodox Priest, so the family fled to Poland when the Russian government outlawed the Ukrainian church. Nana was about 3-4 years old, at the time.\n\nDuring their time in Poland, her older brother by about 10 years, Syeva, lost his eyesight and several fingers while playing with a detonator he had found in the street. The Germans eventually came and an officer took up residence in their house. When things started to get bad, the officer gave Nana's father a heads up, and they fled Poland that night. Eventually, they ended up in Regensburg Displaced Persons camp in Germany where they met the Marchenkos. Syeva became best friends with Mykola and the rest is history.\n\nAfter the families made their way to the United States, Mykola, who was waiting for Alla to grow up and finish high school, eventually went to New York to marry her and brought her back to Chicago, where he was living and working. They had Catherine Elizabeth in June of 1956, George Nicholas in August 1957, William Andrew in May 1961, and Natalie Anne in February 1967.\n\nCatherine married David Ray Saidat in January of 1976.

    "content": "\n!Liquid Castile Soap – 100% Olive Oil Liquid Soap Recipe\n\nPlease ensure you are familiar with the basics of soap making including safety requirements before you attempt this or any handmade soap recipe. Please view my soap making safety video here and read my disclaimer here.\n\nThis recipe uses the paste method for liquid soap making whereby an initial soap paste is made and completely saponified (turned to soap) before dilution for use in pump bottles or other containers. \n\n!!Soap Paste Ingredients \n\n**500g olive oil**  \n\nI have noticed that my liquid soap is thicker if I use extra virgin olive oil. I have to do some more rigorous testing to see if this is truly the case, but it seems to be! Any type of olive oil will work for this recipe, I used semi-refined olive oil for the video. \n\n**156g water**  \n\nDistilled or demineralised water is best (makes the clearest soap), but filtered, sanitised drinking water is also fine if it is a soft water type. \n\n**104g potassium hydroxide (KOH)**  \n\nMine is 90% purity. If you have a different strength, you’ll need to recalculate this recipe. This video shows you how I do it.\n\n**104g vegetable glycerine**  \n\nThis is an optional ingredient. If you don’t have glycerine you can replace it with another 104g water. \n\n*Be aware that glycerine acts as a solvent in this recipe and does wonders to accelerate saponification and prevent separation of oils and lye water as the soap paste is mixed and cooked. This recipe requires a lot more patience and stick blending without the glycerine, but it can be done! Glycerine also adds emollience and extra moisture to the recipe due to its humectant properties, so it’s great to use if you have it. *\n\n!!Dilution water\n\nYou will need between **1700g (1.7 litres) and 2100g (2.1 litres)** of distilled, demineralised or filtered tap water to dilute this full soap paste recipe. Start with 1700g and add more if needed (see video for discussion/demonstration). Note that if you use filtered tap water, your soap may not be perfectly translucent due to minerals in the water.\n\nYou can also dilute just a portion of this soap paste and store the remaining paste in the fridge for later dilution as I do in this video. Start with a dilution ratio of 1 part paste to 1.5 parts water (by weight) and add more water if needed.\n\n!!Other recipe specifications\n\nThe crock pot I used in the video is a small one, it holds 3 litres. If you don’t have a crock pot you can make this soap using a saucepan on the stove on very low heat, or use a double boiler. \n\nThis recipe is made with a 1% superfat, and does not require any additional ingredients to adjust the pH of the soap. See this video about my method for calculating liquid soap recipes for more details and rationale.\n\nThis recipe is calculated with a 1.5 : 1 water to lye ratio for the paste, however with the additional glycerine added (or water if you have no glycerine), the final water to lye ratio becomes 2.5 : 1.\n\nMy potassium hydroxide is 90% purity and the recipe is calculated to factor that in.\n\nThe recipe makes approximately 840g of soap paste and 2.7 litres of finished liquid soap. Your yield may be slightly more or less than mine, depending on evaporation during the cook. \n\n!!Salt solution for thickening\n\nThis is completely optional (I did not use any salt to thicken my soap in the video demonstration) but olive oil based liquid castile soap lends itself quite well to thickening with a 20% salt solution.\n\nIf you are using essential oils (see below) make sure you add those before you thicken the soap with a salt solution. Many essential oils thicken liquid soap by themselves, in which case further thickening with salt is not required.\n\nTo make the salt solution, mix 20g of non-iodised table salt with 80g of distilled (or otherwise purified) water and stir until fully dissolved.\n\nAdd the salt solution to completely cooled and diluted liquid soap, in small amounts (a teaspoon or less to start with), stir thoroughly and leave the soap to thicken for 30-60 minutes before checking. Be careful not to add too much, only slight thickening is recommended. Too much salt can inhibit the lather and will not thicken the soap beyond a certain point. Jackie Thompson in her book Liquid Soap Making (ad link) recommends adding no more than 1% salt solution of the total diluted soap amount (for example, if you have 500g of diluted liquid soap, you would add no more than 5g of 20% salt solution). \n\n!!Essential oils\n\nI did not add any essential oils to my Liquid Castile Soap in the video demonstration, however I usually add essential oils as I decant this soap into individual bottles to use around my household. \n\nI like to use 1-2% essential oils in my finished liquid soap. To calculate this I multiply the weight of the diluted soap (in grams) by 0.01 (1%), 0.015 (1.5%) or 0.02 (2%) to get the amount of essential oil needed, in grams.\n\nIf you would like to fragrance your liquid soap using synthetic fragrance oils, check the manufacturer’s suggested usage rates. If you aren’t sure I would start at 0.5-1% for fragrance oils. A little goes a long way in liquid soap!\n\nBe aware that some essential oils and fragrance oils can dramatically change the texture of liquid soap - some will thicken the soap, some will make it runny. Experiment with small amounts first to see how your oils react with your soap.\n\n!!METHOD\n\n*Please [view the video](https://youtu.be/Q-Ul8NNQZqg.html) for the full tutorial before you start.\n\n#Weigh the olive oil into your crock pot or slow cooker. Turn the cooker up to high to heat the oil. The soap will come together quite easily if the temperature is warm enough. Between 75°C/167°F and 80°C/176°F is ideal. If you do use the high temperature setting to heat your oil up faster (as I do), make sure you watch it closely and turn the cooker down to the low or ‘keep warm’ setting before it gets too hot. 85°C/185°F is the absolute maximum temperature for liquid soap making. Too much hotter and the soap will expand/volcano and will over-oxidise. \n\n#Wearing gloves and goggles for safety, weigh the potassium hydroxide into a small container, cover with a lid and set aside.\n\n#In a medium sized jug, weigh water for the lye solution and when you are ready (with your gloves and goggles on, and a mask if you are in an unventilated area) slowly pour the potassium hydroxide into the water, stirring to dissolve. Set aside somewhere safe.\n\n#Weigh the glycerine into a small bowl and set aside. \n\n#Get your stick blender ready and pour the dissolved lye solution into the warming oil. Start stirring and blending. Be very careful to keep the blades of your blender under the soap surface to avoid splashing. KEEP YOUR SAFETY GOGGLES ON THROUGH THIS ENTIRE PROCESS.\n\n#Add the glycerine soon after mixing the lye solution into the oils. \n\n#Keep an eye on the temperature (see point 1) and stick blend your soap batter off and on between manual stirring, to give your blender a rest, for about 10 minutes or until it thickens to a uniform, thick pudding consistency (see video).\n\n#Cover the soap, turn your cooker down to low or ‘keep warm’ and leave it to cook for 30 minutes or until it becomes glossy and translucent. \n\n#Test the soap paste with pH paper and check it with a clarity test, as demonstrated in the video. If the soap is cooked and fully saponified, no lye remains and the soap paste is ready to dilute.\n\n#Weigh the dilution water. Start with approximately two times the weight of the paste and add more later if needed. \n\n#Add dilution water to the soap pot, cover and let it sit for a few hours on low heat. You can stick blend the soap as I did in the video once it is at least half diluted. This helps it along in the final phase of the dilution.\n\n#Once your soap is diluted and cooled down, if you see a skin forming on the top of the soap, more dilution water is needed. Add more water in small amounts until the soap no longer skins. \n\n#Cool the soap, add essential oils if desired, and pour into bottles for storage or immediate use around the house. A lot of liquid soap makers suggest sequestering the soap for a couple of weeks before use, however I never do this. As long as the soap is fully saponified (and the pH is tested properly) then I am happy using my liquid soap straight away. \n\n!!What about preservatives?\n\nI make my liquid soap for personal use around our household and do not use a preservative for my relatively small batches. This is a great article on the topic of whether or not to use a preservative in your liquid soap. Because I have never used a preservative, I cannot offer you any educated guidance on the topic. Make sure you do your own thorough research in this area, especially if you are giving or selling your liquid soap to others.\n\nSource: [Liquid Castile Soap - 100% Olive Oil Liquid Soap Recipe](https://www.ellyseveryday.com/ellys-everyday-blog/liquid-castile-soap-recipe-100-percent-olive-oil.html)  \n\nUpdated: 2025.08.01 ama"

Roast in the heated oven for 20 minutes, then flip and rotate until deeply golden brown, anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes more.\n# Meanwhile, make the sauce. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a separate large deep pan, heat 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, lower the heat and cook, tossing regularly, until the garlic gains a little bit of color.

Add the pasta to the sauce and give it a good stir. If the sauce looks a bit dry, add a splash of the reserved pasta water and toss until the pasta is well-coated. Taste and adjust seasoning.

The unsaturated fatty acids of the alligator pear stimulate your skin's own natural production of oil (this is not for oily skin).\n\n**Egg**: Eggs are great for your skin. The whites are very astringent and drying, and the yolks are rich in natural moisturizers. Egg yolks are a major source of lecithin, a natural emollient and preservative.\n\n**Plain Yogurt**: Rich in protein, calcium, and vitamins, yogurt makes an excellent mask for all skin types. Yogurt is easily absorbed into the skin and has super softening qualities.\n\n**Strawberries**: Strawberries contain salicylic acid (found in aspirin), which rids the skin of dead cells, allowing it to absorb moisture more efficiently.\n\n**Banana**: Bananas are great for dry skin because they are rich in potassium and vitamin A. They also contain no substances known to aggravate the skin.\n\n**Cucumber**: Grated cucumbers make a gentle and milk astringent mask. It is especially soothing for sunburned skin.\n\n**Mayonnaise**: [Mayonnaise](Mayonnaise.html) has it all - oil, eggs, and vinegar. It is naturally soothing to the skin, and improves skin texture. Mayonnaise is hard to beat for the conditioning power it provides.\n\n**Pear**: Pears are a good source of sorbitol; other fruits that contain a high amount are apples, cherries, plums, and berries. Sorbitol is a humectant that gives a smooth feeling to your skin. Pears are especially soothing for red, blotchy skin. Apply either the fresh juice or the mashed fruit on your face.\n\n**Tomato**: Tomatoes are effective on blackheads and oily skin. The juice of the tomato has astringent properties that help remove dead skin cells and deep-clean the skin's surface.\n\n[Source](Sources.html): Cox, 97-98  \n\nUpdated: 2024.02.15 ama"

    "content": "\n# Sourdough Starter\n\n<<<\nThese instructions will keep one cup of active starter on hand at all times. Most bread recipes call for 1 cup of starter, so you can double the starter instructions to have more on hand, or you can follow the suggested schedule listed below.\n<<<\n\nThere are starters you can buy. Some are cheap, some are expensive. But it's easy to start your own.  \n\n\n# In a clean jar that will hold at least 24 oz., stir together 1/2 cup flour^^1^^ and 1/2 cup warm water.^^2^^ Stir it well. Cover the jar with a clean cloth and a rubberband, and wait 24 hours.\n# Place 1/2 cup of your starter in a new jar, and add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup warm water. Stir it together well. Cover again and wait 24 hours. You can throw out the remaining starter from the first jar.\n# Repeat Step 2.\n# On the fourth day, you will repeat step 2, but only wait 12 hours before the next feeding. By now, you should notice bubbling in the starter. Continue feeding it every 12 hours.\n# After about 10 days, the starter should be strong enough to raise bread. You also want it to be relatively thick - it should be the consistency of thick glue. If it's not thick enough, add a little extra flour at the next feeding. If it's too thick, add a little extra water.^^4^^\n# When the starter gets to this point, you should be able to feed it every 24 hours again to maintain it.\n# Once you have enough activity, you can start using the discard for something like [Sourdough Pancakes](Sourdough Pancakes.html), [Sourdough Crepes](Sourdough Crepes.html), or [Sourdough Pizza Crust](Sourdough Pizza Crust.html). You can also measure off two portions of starter and setup two new jars. Keep one out to rise, and put the second one in the fridge. Be sure to feed the backup jar at least once a week.^^3^^\n# You now have a starter ready to make [Sourdough Bread](Sourdough Bread.html), [Sourdough English Muffins](Sourdough English Muffins.html), or anything else you can think of. Mama also has a worksheet on her computer that allows you to convert any bread recipe into a sourdough recipe.\n\n## Suggested Schedule\n* Feed the starter at least once a day, preferably in the morning.\n* In the morning, separate the starter into 1/2 cup for feeding, and 1/2 cup for proofing. Put the feeder in a jar and cover, as usual, and the proofer in a mixing bowl.\n* 12 hours later (in the evening), use the proofer as recommended in the [Sourdough Bread](Sourdough Bread.html) recipe. Add the flour, water, and salt and proof over night.\n* The next morning, feed your starter as normal, and place the proofer in the pan for the last rise. If you want, you can use the jarred starter to start proofing another loaf.\n* After 4 hours, bake your proofed bread as stated in the recipe.\n\nIf you want to find out more about sourdough, you can check out these websites that I go to regularly:  \n\n* [Sourdough Home](https://sourdoughhome.com.html)\n\n^^1^^ Some people swear by whole grain wheat flour or rye flour. I just used plain all-purpose white flour and had good results.  \n\n^^2^^ Some sources swear that tap water with chlorine will not work to start a starter. I have started with tap water with no problems, and I used spring water from the store. I honestly can't say if one was better than the other. The starter worked both ways.  \n\n^^3^^ To feed the backup jar, take it out the night before and let it come to room temperature. Do a regular feeding in the morning and leave it to rise. At night, do one more regular feeding, but put it back in the fridge.  \n\n^^4^^ I have found that sometimes the starter gets a little thin. That's ok - as long as it gets bubbly, it's still active. But if you want it to rise, it needs to be thicker. If it's getting thin, then short the water when feeding it. You can use as little as 1/4 cup.\n\n[Source](Sources.html): Aumann  \n\nUpdated: 2024.01.29 ama"

Add in the flour and breadcrumbs, and combine once again.\n# A quick note on bread crumbs, I recommend using finer bread crumbs over Panko. Start with 1/4-1/2 cup worth and add more as needed.\n# The mixture should come together easily and form a big meatball. You can make a quick patty and toss it from hand to hand to make sure it won't fall apart.\n# You can also make a slider patty and fry it up to test out the seasoning if you wish, and then adjust as needed after tasting.\n# Form patties to preferred size; I recommend 2 oz. for a thin smash style patty, 4 oz. for a normal sized patty.\n# To cook, simply get a pan up to medium heat, add some oil and cook on each side for about 3-4 minutes or until nicely browned. Season as you like! When you flip the patty, add a slice of vegan cheese, then a little water to the pan. Cover to stead and melt the cheese, and then load up a bun with all the fixings!\n\nSource: https://theeburgerdude.com/vegan-burger-patties/#recipe  \n\nUpdated: 2025.01.19 ama"

    "content": "\n# White Sauce\n\nMany sauces use a similar formula. What makes them different is what you put in it. The basic formula for any sauce is:\n\n* 1 T fat\n* 1 T starch (flour or cornstarch, usually)\n* 1 C liquid\n\nYou melt the fat, stir in the starch and cook it a little, then gradually whisk in the liquid. You can make it thicker by increasing the fat and starch. You make it thinner by increasing the liquid. Here are the details for a good white sauce.\n\n## Ingredients\n* 1 T butter or shortening\n* 1 T all-purpose flour (white or wheat)\n* 1 C milk (whole milk works well because of the fat content)\n* 1/2 - 1 tsp salt\n* 1/4-1/2 tsp ground pepper\n* herbs of choice\n* 1/2 tsp sugar, optional (a lot of Southern cuisine calls for this)\n\n## Directions\n# In a small saucepan, melt the butter.\n# Sprinkle in the flour and stir until smooth. Continue stirring over medium-low to medium heat for about 2 minutes.\n#* You can continue to cook it until it starts to turn brown, which is signature in some cuisines.\n# Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly. I like to pour a little at a time, stirring in between until it's smooth. You can also do it in a trickle, stirring constantly.\n# Once all the milk is poured in, stir in your seasonings and herbs.\n# Continue cooking and stirring until thickened. Do NOT boil.\n# Use as desired.\n\nSource: Aumann, Mandi - I first learned this in Home Economics in middle school, but have used plenty of sauces through the years.  \n\nUpdated: 2025.09.12 ama"
